Author's decription:

Started off with the Pointer and Earth. Made all of the other ones then. The crosshair cursor I took from the Gold Orb set (The 21st cursor set).

P.S. I did not make the pointer and the earth in the waiting cursors. Credit for those goes to Kai Fiebach (he made Blue Marble for Civilization IV (Great game!))
