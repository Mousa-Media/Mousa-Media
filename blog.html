  <h2>Confidence is reassurance, not entitlement</h2>

 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">
  Good day to everyone reading this. First I would like to shout out myself for making it, I am the best this is my website, this is my blog and nobody is doing it like me in 2024, I am soooo go—<i>*INCORRECT BUZZER SOUND*</i>. Okay now for real though, hello everyone thank you so much for reading my blog today on my new website. I am still very much excited about everything right now, but today I would like to speak on the dangers of not understanding what true confidence is. </p>

    <p class="blog"> As of late, I have been moving a lot in both my professional and creative spaces. It has gotten to the point where I wake up and instantly go to work. This has been a great flow for me in the past and it helped me build myself up again due to my previous experiences of hopelessness that I expressed in my previous blog. For me working makes me feel good, when I make progress it is hard to not get excited. If anything it is good to get excited, but I started to get this rush, a feeling of superiority.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">When it comes to art I have a fatal flaw, when I start getting things in place I genuinely start to feel like a god. Like I need to throw water on my face to chill out because I get so hyped about myself that it blinds me from areas I can improve upon. I know this flaw is not who I am, because of how much I hate that side of me. I needed to understand what true confidence is. To me, confidence is reassurance, not entitlement.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Before we understand reassurance we first must contextualize confidence as entitlement. Confidence as entitlement lives solely in the ego. You are confident because you think you deserve praise due to your own greatness, You chant mantras of being the “G.O.A.T” but you average 31 monthly listeners</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog"> Shameless self-plug aside, this mindset is dangerous because it forces you to rely on outside validation as well as generates a false sense of superiority. The truth of the matter is you are not the G.O.A.T and the next time you drop there is always a chance that nobody will be moved by it. It doesnt matter who you are because it can happen to anyone and everyone. So is it still confidence if it only makes you more vulnerable and limits your own growth? Of course not, this is just a loud insecurity.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">I have fallen in that trap a plenty before, and it just leads to an inevitable cruel taste of reality. Well, it is only cruel if you believe in the delusions of grandeur your mind generates for you. This is why I have decided to practice what true confidence is. The confidence in self-reassurance changed my entire perspective on everything and has made me enjoy what I do again in every field.</p>
    <br> 
    <p class="blog">True confidence has to come from within and is built around the belief that YOU can build yourself up and improve. This true confidence doesn’t blind you from flaws but instead makes you more open to hearing criticism and working on yourself. Often times the most confident people are the quietest. You have nothing to prove when you are confident and make every move for the sake of what you like. I am now a confident creator, in everything I make I am a fan of it now, I know it is flawed and I can take criticism because I love my work so much that I just want to get better.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">This is why I created my chop wood carry water series, my website, and my blogs. I no longer fear perception, if anything being perceived will only make me see my own flaws. The only way we can prove our existence to ourselves is through the lens of others. I exist because I’m here, but I know I’m real because I am seen. Whatever reaction I get from being seen doesn’t affect me because of the strength I get from being seen. To me, that is the ultimate reassurance. I have the power to put myself out there and it doesn’t matter what happens because I feel good about it at the end.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">People are important to the creative process and you need a good balance of those who are fans, and those who are critical of you. But to take you’re strength from their perception will ultimately lead to a dangerous crash out.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Cinema Outside the big screen</h2>

   <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
   <p class="blog">
    As of late, I have been a huge fan of films and movies. I am borderline a film buff, the only difference between me and them is that I don't pay for letterbox pro hahaha. the word cinematic means a lot to me because to me it means larger than life. and as someone alive, I can say that being larger than life means it is HUGE. The art of being cinematic in movies is hard enough, but to translate that feeling into other art forms is just jaw-droppingly impressive. Today I would like to shine the spotlight on some of my favorite cinematic pieces of work that aren't movies. </p>

      <p class="blog">This might be my favorite thing Fujimoto has ever made. This short one-shot story is a real-life love letter to films in the form of a manga. The manga opens up with a kid named Yuta who is filming his mother's death. It is a slow and emotional opening. Fujimoto uses this technique of repetition in manga panels in order to create this film reel effect that just adds to the feeling of it being a movie. Another thing that is cool is the use of motion blur and the camera quality in this section compared to the rest of the manga. It is all so very interesting and makes this manga feel more authentic. take a look at this</p>

      <p class="blog"> And boom we made it to the ultimate reveal, this was a film competition. the explosion was just part of the movie, and we get back to reality. but this does not stop the cinematics from existing as Yuta continues to film in the real world as well. with these next images please notice when the in-universe camera starts recording </p>

      <p class="blog">The manga continues to do this through its run time and just gets wilder as we get deeper into the plot. I only wanted to speak on the first few pages because I do not wish to spoil anything. Please go read this, it is my favorite manga ever and I am so glad Fujimoto continued to use the repetition motif in Chainsaw Man Part 2, i love how cinematic his work is.</p>
      <p class="blog">2) Music</p>
      <p class="blog">Music can 100% be cinematic, as of late I have fallen deep in love with the idea of a concept album. a concept album is an album that focuses on one central idea and theme. these albums tend to follow a character as they go through a journey and we find the start and end of the album to be drastically different in terms of mindstates.
"Mr.Morale and the Big Steppers" is a great example of a concept album with a character. the main theme of the album is generational trauma as well as external pressure. Kendrick uses himself as a character to make something that is both personal and relatable. the first disc on this project focuses on the problems Kendrick has. the first track serves as a perfect introduction to the elusive Kendrick, we learn that he has been going through something over one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five days and follows it with the phrase "be afraid". this builds the listener's curiosity. the following tracks are aggressive and brutal in terms of subject matter, N95 and Worldwide Steppers are about Kendrick's insecurities and vices. N95 Kendrick asks "Where the hypocrites at" as he uses the track to criticize the general rap community for fake activism and overall lack of realness. this goes into worldwide steppers being a personal confession of Kendricks's lust addiction. this humanizes Kendrick and makes us realize that Kendrick is also feeling guilty about the reason why the world is that way. Diehard is him pleading that is not too late to fix himself, but when he is faced with the solution of therapy he sends a rebuttal of his not needing into therapy,  as the next track "Father Time plays". This next arc of the album has rich spirit, celebrating what Kendrick has gone through and how he is thankful that he is who he is. This keeps him distracted from his problems. We are ultimately hit with a wall where we see that it is all a front, "we cry together" is an example of how his view of women and past trauma has changed his view of women and relationships. The final word on "We Cry Together" is to stop tap dancing around the conversation. Tap dancing is a motif throughout the album and is most prevalent on tracks where Kendrick is directly talking to the listener. "savior" on disc 2 is a great example of the tap dance motif. Kendrick gives the listener the truth of not idolizing these rappers (and LeBron) and after every statement comes tap dancing. It is a way to tell the listener to pay attention and not to tap dance around the truth. the 2nd disc overall is titled Breakthrough and it circles around Kendrick realizing the trauma and problems in his life are something he needs to tackle. "Auntie Diaries" is a story about him recalling his experience of being insensitive to a trans family member but growing up and accepting them. "Mother I Sober" is a track where he finally comes to realize that he does need help, the sober truth is a powerful one. "Mirror" is the outro and Kendrick comes full circle and realizes that he is not the listener's savior, and wants to focus on building his own life. I love this album so much man, it grew on me heavily because I truly can relate to some of the things he says, which is something I could never really say with his music.</p>
      <p class="blog">3) Video Games</p>
      <p class="blog">Video games have come a long way since being about virtual tennis, we now have virtual tennis with silly characters :D. but in all seriousness video games are a valid art form and can be a great tool for someone to experience a story. I can pick a lot of great examples of great cinematic games, but I think my recent favorite video game of mine would be "Stray". the game sort of fell into a strange realm of being overhyped, but it is talked about for the wrong reasons in my opinion. I like playing as a silly cat more than anyone else I know, but we fail to see the bigger picture and true beauty of the game.</p>
      <img src="https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/16162533/SEI_118880616.jpg?crop=16:9,smart&width=1200&height=675&upscale=true" style="width: 90%;
      display: block;
      margin: 0 auto;">
      <p class="blog">what made this game feel so cinematic to me was its amazing score and use of lighting. exploring the game world felt fun and rewarding even if the gameplay was really basic. Games like these are often criticized for being style over substance, but I personally find a lot of enjoyment in these short experiences where everything in the world has a purpose rather than a huge open-world triple-A mess with bugs and stupid shit. I like a short game, i am a grown-ass man if I am playing a game alone best believe it is something with a dope story. It's hard for me to really explain the beauty of stray without just recommending you to play it for yourself. it is a really short and replayable game that I can tackle on a sick day so I recommend you play it in one sitting too.</p>
      <p class="blog">4) Life</p>
      <p class="blog">Life is the ultimate piece of cinema if you make it one. There are moments in life that feel so grand and meaningful. This one is the hardest feeling to capture, but the sweetest one to feel. In life, there isn't editing and countless teams working to give you the perfect lighting, dialogue, and emotions, sometimes it just happens and when it happens naturally it feels truly ethereal. Of course, since these moments happen without planning it is our job as people to pay attention and live in the present. today is the best gift we can ever receive and nothing about it should be taken for granted. This was a lesson I had to learn for myself, in my damn near 22 years of living it feels like I have seen a lot. The truth is nobody truly knows my full story even those I'm closest to, I can just wake up and drop a truth bomb on my family and friends if I so choose to do so. I find that aspect to be empowering personally, people find me charming and captivating for the person I present myself as more so than the story that lies underneath. With that power and knowledge I bestow though it can come to hurt me, for a while it felt like nothing was exciting me. I hate college in all honesty, I am just too locked into getting this degree to complain about it. I became someone who only seeks satisfaction from my stress, because in my mind in the end it will all be worth it. If I wasn't working then I was dying, this is how I felt. Hanging out with friends, and making art, it all felt pointless to me for a bit, mentally I just had leaving on my mind. I have recently come to realize that, my old way of viewing the world was just a delayed suicide, I was losing the joy in my life because I have truly felt like I have seen and done it all. I was bored, but I was bored because I made it boring. my constant worrying about the future led me to never enjoy the present.</p>
      <p class="blog">Mentally I had to change; I decided to take reading and enjoying art into my life again. With these inspirations in my life, I started to notice parallels, after all, life imitates art. "What do I mean by this?" you may be asking. Well allow me to explain with an analogy, I used to view my life as if I were an anime character in a shitty shonen anime. I didn't even view myself as a main character I felt like a side character whose only two plots are working or the stupid "filler episodes" where I would do something with my life that truly didn't affect me in the slightest. Filler arcs for me were things like playing video games, consistently sleeping, drinking, and just being a degenerate. My character didn't grow or change as much the work I did just funded the fillers leaving me back at 0. I felt a void in my soul, I would justify my filler arcs by stating "Oh I worked so hard I deserve this" not realizing that said fillers are the reason I go back to 0.</p>
      <p class="blog">Now I view my life as a director, and whatever I make is my choice. Being a director allows you to dictate how your own story goes. My pain from working isn't just what I am about, it is instead development for me, and I reinvest that pain into motivating myself to grow and mature. Classic tropes of storytelling like the hero's journey are something you can and should apply to your life. it is a journey you will go on when facing anything in life, and when you anticipate and plan out how your story is then you can find true enjoyment in the process of getting to the end of enlightenment. You are the director of your life, so give yourself a direction and enjoy every step of the process because it is these trials that will make you better than you were.</p>

      margin: 0 auto;">
      <p class="blog">This is why people don't find life cinematic. We all make goals and have dreams but we fail to plan the steps in between. I want to play the piano but thinking about practicing it makes me want to die, this was a mindset I used to have, and it made the world feel all the more cruel and uninspired. The mindset is you need to chop wood and carry water. That means you need to enjoy the process of becoming great. Find the beauty in practicing that piano and contrast it with the hero's journey to plot your progress. Figure out why you want to be great and let it motivate you, when you have a purpose everything matters, and when everything matters that is when you have a cinematic moment.</p>
      <p class="blog">So next time you are feeling life is dull, just look around and realize 1) am I where I want to be and 2) how can I change. once you set that plan take one last look around, look at the colors of your life, and the sounds, and contrast them with movies you have seen and you will find parallels. Same with your growth this is your training montage in real time, and the payoff is the rewarding climax. Once you reach the end of that arc, it doesn't mean your story is over. Remember you are the director and when you are ready it is on you to start your next project. So be sure to enjoy it all</p>
