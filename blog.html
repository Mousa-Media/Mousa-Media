  <h2>Stories are more than just the plot</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">I recently posted on my ig story about how much I hate talking about albums, and I actually got a lot of engagement on that tiny rant. It gave me the inspiration to actually sit down and think deeper on “why” I truly didn’t want to write on something I love so dearly, and after hours of dwelling it dawned on me many mainstream releases lack a story or any true cohesion to truly warrant discussion. I know this isn’t due to a lack of my own skill. If you follow me on tiktok you should have seen that I have recently got into the manga “Berserk”. I have posted 4 videos around 10 minutes each dissecting these volumes and giving praise and connecting with the characters and story of this amazing manga. Berserk was a story I got into when it was truly hard for me to feel anything. The only thing I had to keep me going was stories, hopeful ones, tragic ones, fantasy, reality, all genres I just needed something to grasp onto. I am thankful to be reading berserk and I am currently on volume 9 of the deluxe’s. In addition to Berserk I have watched some fantastic shows, movies and to bring it back to music I have listened to some truly phenomenal albums that I can write essays on just because of their stories and depth. It made me look back on my draft of my “albums of 2024” and take a deep and depressed sigh. I deeply despise the way mainstream artists and executives are approaching projects in all mediums. Just this week I read an article about Netflix executives telling writers to make characters announce their actions so that idle viewers can still catch onto the show. I think this is absolutely absurd and disgusting to the artform of television. I already was on thin ice with tv shows and their constant cliff hangers and cheap gimmicks to attain viewers but the streaming era had watered down every “must see” series to a marketing campaign for the streaming services that have the rights to them. Every show is made with extensive focus group testing, aesthetic appeal and virality in mind these days. Netflix even goes through the effort to constantly update tv show banners to encourage users to click and engage, but for me this creates the opposite effect. Instead of having unique and representative iconography for shows everything has become a homogenized conglomerate of dramatic faces you don’t even know staring back at you. I fucking hate this shit with my whole soul and finding something that doesn’t want to make me kill myself on netflix is harder than taking a piss in a minefield. I truly hate Netflix and what they are doing to the art of storytelling.

    <p class="blog">In this blog I will tackle literature, television, and music to argue why storytelling is important in all these mediums and why I think the mainstream is trying to steer us away from such things. This is a topic I have just recently found myself to be passionate about, but as the year comes to a close I have come to the conclusion that many of my frustrations with the world I inhabit stem from the dilution of art in the mainstream. It is true everything that comes out still has a plot/concept/theme, but do these things have anything that you can’t summarize in just one tweet? In a world of oversaturation and instant gratification many companies have come to realize that there is no value in investing into one big project that will just get drowned out after a week, they instead would rather try to attach onto the cultural psyche through small clips/songs/memes in order to stay relevant out of sheer vitality. It is nothing more than an artistic parasite that latches onto our culture until it has sucked every stream of revenue dry. We live in a world where Hawk Tuah can be a podcast, currency and clothing brand. There is nothing sacred and the top of the mountain is built on the carcasses of thousands of beaten horses. </p>

    <p class="blog">The art game is low key deceiving in that regard. The longer I analyze and enjoy art the more I come to realize the “biggest” and the “greats” are nothing more than frauds and wolves who prey on smaller artists. Do I care? No not really, I still like Drake's music because it sounds good. I know he isn't the best but I don’t care. I don’t think the best artists should be the biggest, I think it is impossible to be great and appeal to such a wide market of people. You can be good this is true, you can have projects that sell like crazy and sound amazing even. I think Michael Jackson’s thriller is a perfect example of what I am talking about here, to me this is a perfect album, every song on there is a hit, it sounds good, and his vocal performance is spectacular, but I don’t know a single soul who has thriller as their favorite album. I love Michael Jackson, but if you ask me I think his best album is Dangerous or Invincible because he was telling a story. The burden of being the biggest artist in the world while also fighting against your own record label, being drugged and paranoid, the man had real demons he was fighting and the music post reflected a more dark side of Michael Jackson that I find to be raw and authentic. He was able to balance those dark themes with also his most human and genuine ballads. On “Invincible” he gives us the songs “butterflies” and “heaven can wait” which are some of his best romantic cuts in my opinion and tracks like “Cry” “Privacy" and “Invincible” are some of his most blunt lyrics to date. It is a shame it was his last project; his paranoia and fears turned out to be true. Sony blackballed Invincible and the doctors prescribed him medication while the media kept pursuing Michael Jackson which would ultimately lead to his early grave. MJ was a tortured soul if you ask me, and I truly think his run from Dangerous - Invincible was the most free he has ever been in terms of his artistic expression. The stories he told are the reasons he died, his albums didn’t sell as well when he was talking about racism and the media. Go back and listen to “morphine” and “ghost” when you have the time as well.

<p class="blog">Contrasting MJ with Beyonce, I found myself to have a lot of trouble when writing about Beyonce’s album “Cowboy Carter” and I think I know why. I will be honest I love cowboy carter, I think it is filled with so many great songs and beyonce is an amazing vocalist and the song writing on cowboy carter is filled with some of her best lines. But yet when I sat down and typed about this album I came to an abrupt stop, as quickly as words filled my doc is as quickly as they stopped. I had nothing to really say about cowboy Carter and it killed me deeply. I can shine light on Beyonce being a beacon of black artists in country music. I think it is great that artists like Shaboozy, Willie Jones and Tanner Adell got time to shine. She was able to legitimize CC by pairing these up and comers with real country legends like Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and Linda Martell. Then there is the ugly side of the album, how can I claim empowerment when she also features Miley Cyrus and Post Malone? No hate to these people as individuals, and I have no true right to speak on what is what, but as an outsider I find it backhanded to give feature slots to white artists who used black culture as an aesthetic to get big while you are trying to make a legitimate country album. I don’t think cowboy carter is a fake country album like critics argued, I think it is truly a country album and still much better than the watered down “bro-country” era we are currently in. but as an album I have come to realize that it is meandering. The album starts off really strong with American Requiem, it feels like a rally cry, the chorus says “can we stand for something” then the remainder of the album is about how much she likes being a mom, being rich and fucking jay-z…. Sooo like beyonce? Are we standing for Jay-Z dick game? What is the point here??? Like the songs are great I love alligator tears, II hands II Heaven, and Desert Eagle, but the promise and aesthetics of revolutions ultimately fall shallow and that is a fair criticism of the album in my opinion. I am happy that it led to other artists blowing up, I am personally a fan of Shaboozy because he is from woodbridge!  PS I will still be at the beyonce concert too fuck all that hating shit nobody touching her on stage!
</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">Another project that made me rethink albums was actually a project I wrote a whole blog about (crazy dickriding I know). Travis Scott's Utopia is a project that drives me insane to think about. I am actually so embarrassed by the fact I gave the album the time to write about it, because there is nothing to write about. The album sounds like it is saying something important but in truth there is no substance whatsoever. It makes me so mad, actually, “Telekinesis” is one of the most lazy and forgettable vocal performances by all 3 artists. Future comes in talking about hoes, then Travis talks about seeing the future and hearing your thoughts but still asking “do you like the way it sounds” it literally contradicts his whole verse which is genuinely so lazy and whatever. SZA comes in with the horns at their loudest and what is she talking about in this triumphant moment? Her fucking ex… what is the point like actually it feels like 3 different demos just combined into one song. That is basically how the whole album plays out to me, the production and feel creates the illusion of substance yet it leaves me feeling cut. Now I would just excuse the album as another “travis scott” album and take it for the fun that it is, but Travis himself wanted me to take this album seriously, he even came out with a short film about the album and it featured none other than “genius” rick rubin. I despise the way Rick Rubin is glazed over by music fans, he is praised as being this guru for making great albums but I am not impressed with his work. Firstly the guy is responsible for the red hot chili peppers… ew and secondly his most praised work being “yeezus” is an album I would argue would have been better without his involvement. Kanye's yeezus was originally going to be more maximalist and brash as an attack on both the fashion and music world. The clear cd album cover is the open casket to what is the death of the cd era of music as the album would be just on the edge of streaming taking over just a few years later. The original version of yeezus would have featured a 12 minute version of on sight and if you ask me I think the album would have been more iconic if it leaned into being more experimental. Now back to Utopia, it is funny because that album had a movie and it featured travis talking to Rick Rubin like he is Yoda in Dagobah and he just gives off the most bullshit shallow advice I have ever heard, I mean it genuinely made me cringe. I hate the short film because it is everything wrong with the album x100.

<p class="blog">Okay, I must relax now. How about albums I like… that is the good news! I have been listening to a ton of albums I genuinely love and feel a connection to through their use of storytelling beyond shallow themes and emotional cues. The first album I would like to give a shout out to is “Never Catch the Light” by Joshua Lanuarii. This is a new album and I am still listening to it a ton and growing new thoughts and opinions on it, but it is one of the few albums I listen to and have to sit and think afterwards because emotionally it was that heavy for me on my first listen. The album is written and produced in such a dark and mature tone. It doesn’t just sound meaningful, it is meaningful. The album is filled with recurring themes and motifs and it rewards you for listening and paying close attention. One that resonated with me the most is the theme of betrayal. Many of the most tragic lines are followed by the word “baby” . The cover of bang bang too just emphasises the point of being betrayed by someone who is close to you. Lastly the lyrics tend to have powerful and intense imagery, an example that resonated with me the most would be on “Lament” “You sunk your teeth inside my brain, it seeped into my eyes”.  I think The album has many other themes and the songs are sequenced in such a way where it truly feels intentional and rewarding to sit with the album as a whole. My favorite moment has to be the “under the moon” and “now until forever” back to back. The way those songs connect thematically feels logical yet emotionally charged and I genuinely got goosebumps when the tracks played back to back. And this isn't a cheap transition, don’t expect a corny beat transition or extended sample bullhshit. This is a thematic transition and if you pay attention to the lyrics and find the foreshadowing then the emotional “payoff” of hearing now until forever feels all the more personal. All in all I really did resonate with this album and I think people can pick up their own emotional connection thanks to the masterful use of storytelling beyond aesthetics.

<p class="blog">Another album I have become a fan of is “Tallahassee” by the mountain goats, this is a concept album about a married couple moving to Florida despite their dysfunctional marriage. To me the album is a masterclass in storytelling. The song “southwood plantation road” literally starts with the line “I got you, you got whatever is left of me to get.” Another stand out line is on the song “Game shows touch our lives” and it goes “Your drunken kiss is as light as the air, Maybe everything that falls down eventually rises, Our house sinking into disrepair, Ah, but look at this showroom, filled with fabulous prizes”. The album sound wise probably isn't for everyone, but the lyrics read like poetry to me, I would at least recommend checking out “No Children” off that album. It is packed tight with great lyrics.

<p class="blog">In the world of tv I noted earlier the rise of streaming and casual viewing is killing off great shows due to them being prematurely canceled by networks who just want viral hits. Well now I want to shine light on a show I have seen recently, that show being “Moral Orel”. Moral Orel is a show I got completely wrong. I had always thought of it as some super edgy reddit atheist ass show, but when I sat down and actually analyzed the complexities and development of the story I found something that was truly heartfelt and endearing. Moral Orel is without a doubt a top 5 adult swim show for me and it’s depictions of religious hypocrisy, alcoholism and generational trauma are some of the best I have ever seen on TV. especially by adult swim standards I was impressed to see a show from 2006 not using these problems as cheap punchlines but instead building on them and giving depth to the show. The show wasn’t constantly trying to jump the shark and make things worse,instead it was trying to make things move forward. The 2nd half of season 2 through the season 3 finale are some of the best episodes of the show and you can notice the significant leap in writing and cohesion throughout the story. They started to care about the side cast and even gave them powerful and deep arcs, my favorite being the reverend and his daughter reconnecting and being an example of a good relationship (paternal) in the show. Another massive victory the show takes in storytelling is through its portrayal of Clay, who is Orel’s father and main antagonist. He was always a manipulative and destructive person but his alcoholism and wrath became worse as the show went on, and the biggest arc revolves around orel standing up for himself to his father. What I do like though is that we see where his father comes from and we can sympathize for Clay due to being in a marriage he never wanted, his own fathers abuse and his closested homosexuality. It is a tragic character but his actions are still rightfully treated as evil, and I find that to be a very hard rope to balance when writing a villain. The finale of the show (not including the special) is the best episode in my opinion. It gives me the perfect emotional payoff because I was invested in the story.

<p class="blog">Even in the world of literature, I find myself to be disappointed by the rise of self help books. I have been recommended these books countless times and I have read a few to some varying quality, but to be blunt I just don’t like the genre at all. The lessons and morals expressed in these works can be good, but to me they will never stick because I have no emotional attachment to what I read. The best “help” book I read was probably “Contagious”, this was a book I was required to read for a sales class I took back in college, but it stuck with me because they told stories to explain why their sales method of going viral worked. I really enjoyed that book and one thing that they talked about in the book was the need for a story as well, and I think Jonah Berger is a perfect example of practicing what he preaches by writing a book that was genuinely helpful and enjoyable to read. For the most part though, many of these self help books sell you with their provocative and bright covers just to be mind numbingly dull and filled with regurgitated lessons that ultimately stems down to “Don’t quit”, “keep going” or whatever mantra they choose to preach. I think for true inspiration to be better, we need stories both fictional and true because as humans we do have emotions and need a connection to create a “why” to things. For me I get inspiration from “berserk”, “grief is for people” and “The vanishing half” . These are all great pieces of literature filled with true emotional attachment and exceptional storytelling and will stand the test of time as great works.

<p class="blog">So what is the point here? Why is everything so dumbed down? Well that is a question that can have many differnt valid answers, but for me it stems down to three things. Shortening atention spans, the rise of viral marketing and the introduction of bowl culture. Firstly it is a scientifically proven fact that our attention spans have been shortened drastically and it is just getting worse generation by generation. I beleive it stems from being overstimulated at such a young age that we are conditioned to seek the most pleasure with the least amount of work. I think the attention span is more so a sideeffect of the other two answers I have today and I will be moving along to viral marketing. I used to be in the marketing world and I even graduated with a degree in marketing, but I have grown to not really like that line of work at all. I mean I got respect for the people who do it, but I could not. Viral marketing is a business strategy that is meant to maximize views and the attention of the public. Super bowl commericials, publicity stunts, trends, and social media are all tools used for companies to go viral not just online but in the public subconcious. We know the geico commercials so well now that it is to the point where they can reuse their old charachters as if it were a cinematic universe. We no longer are consuming original content but rather regergitated and remixed slop that only has meaning because of it’s prior context. Everything is masked in irony or legacy just for there to be no face beneath the mask. Everything that comes out is designed to capture the attention of specific demographics and to engineer them to feel a way about a product, brand or idea regardless on if it is truly genuine. Lastly I wish to speak on bowl culutre, this comes from an article I read over the summer by Mark Sabano, he is easily one of my favorite creatives in any field and his understanding of the world we inahbit is worth looking into. To paraphrase the theisis of bowl culture, mark used the comparssion of those chipotle type resturants. Think back to when chipotle first got big and how everyone wanted to eat bowls of rice and meat. The concept was cost effective and the illusion of value was created by the padding of rice to make consumers feel they are eating good. Other companies took note and came out with their own concepts of “Chiptole but… (insert ethnic cusine)”. And with each concept the line between authentic cuisine and slop began to blur. Bowl food is food stripped of any unique identiy. It lacks presentation, the ingredients all become sloppy and messy and no matter what you order it will all ultimately taste very samey. You aren’t eating mexican food but the concept of if mexican food was served to a dog. These bowls are sloppy and encourage people to eat them as fast as possible thanks to their portable design and lack of any prep on their end all you need is a spoon and a mouth to shove that in. these resturants are a byproduct of the greater culture of the need to shove slop down our minds just to fill the void that used to inhabit things like our creativity, desire and imagination. The food is faintly reminiscent of something good just like the shows on netflix feel like they are really good. But alas it is nothing more than an illusion we tell ourselves.

<br>
<br>
<p class="blog">Stories are the spice we need to excite the art we consume. We aren’t animals and shouldnt consume out of the metaphorical bowl just for the sake of filling the time. Our lives are finite, we only have so many meals, minutes, hours and days. The legacy we leave behind is our story just like our ancestors before us. A good story will always stand the test of time, and it goes deeper than just the actions and process. A good story ulitmately is about the people and the emotions behind the actions. Something mundane like a romance novel can be more gripping to read compared to a textbook about war, because one author was going for information and the other was going for a good story. When we seek out entertainment why not enjoy something that is flavorful with the taste fo a good story.

  <h2>The best christmas song of all time</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">There have been a lot of amazing songs for christmas, we got classics like silent night, feliz navidad, and jingle bells, we also got modern BANGERS from gucci mane, tyler the creator and Bryon Tiller. But if you ask me the best song of all has to be Last Christmas by Wham! First of all we must be specific about which version of the song and if you ask me you must play the pudding mix version of it because it feels wayyy more festive. Now go listen to it right now!</p>

    <p class="blog">Oh hey ur back great, because now we are going to talk about it, and by talk I mean I will yap about why I love this song so much. First of all the story goes George and his bandmate Andrew were at George’s parents house watching futbol, George went into his bedroom and wrote the song in an hour. They made the song in June and during the studio session they decorated the studio and wore xmas sweaters. It is totally awesome. When the single came out in December they even donated all the money to charity! Literally it is impossible to hate the song if you ask me.

    <br>
    <p class="blog">Now the song instantly became a classic charting at number 2, but in 2024 it actually charted number 1! It is so replayable because it isn't just a good christmas song, it’s a good song that just so happens to use Christmas as a setting. The song is really about a heartbreak and moving on, but the messaging is as hopeful as it is uncertain. The motif of giving his heart to someone special shows that he isn’t afraid of moving forward and giving up on love, but lines like “but if you kiss me now, I know you’d fool me again” and “I keep my distance but you still catch me eye” show that he hasn’t completely moved on from his ex. The song keeps twisting on that motif the 2nd verse ends with “Now I’ve found a real love, you’ll never fool me again.”. He is slowly moving on and knows what real love is, but yet he still does feel a pain in thinking his ex was someone special.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Nobody likes to feel used, especially when so much of the holidays centers around love. We want to remain hopeful even on a down year. I think this is why so many people gravitate, relate or just sympathize with the song. Like I don’t relate to the song, but the way he sings the last chorus on the pudding mix just cuts through my soul. Those extra vocal harmonies and his range is just so impressive. Hell give the acapella version a listen, the guy is just that good. There is a reason why every cover of this song is worse, it’s because nobody can sing like George. 
    </p>

    <p class="blog">Lastly I must talk about the music video and how gorgeous everyone is. George Michael with the blond hair and earrings looked like a power couple next to model Kathy Hill. truly they are both the most beautiful people I have ever laid my eyes on. I am so sorry y'all. The wardrobe too is just superb and the way the video is just genius. It is able to create the cold distant feeling of a past lover and juxtapose it with the warm feeling of xmas so well with it’s use of lighting and mixing between outdoor shots in the snow and warm indoor shots at a fancy feast. It is just a true classic and I highly recommend it.

  <h2>Why you should read other people's diaries.</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">Disclaimer: this blog is 100% fictitious and is merely an idea I had, read it as if it were true and enjoy it nonetheless. You should never read someone's diary or journal because it is a complete invasion of privacy and a sure fire way to lose all trust and goodwill you may have. I journal myself and I find the idea of a book holding my most intimate thoughts to be terrifying, I would never wish for my journal to be read let alone anyone else's. That being said, I decided to write a short fictional story with the prose of a blog, in order to explore the idea of shared intimacy. The idea that even when it is just you and the paper there are still people out there who will see you and understand you. I want to explore the good and the bad of this shared existence we have even when it comes to our most personal thoughts. I promise there is a point to those who will listen, thank you and have a great one.

    <p class="blog">Honestly what a meaningless existence I have. Oh woe is the writer who has nothing to write. The pain in my heart won’t sell copies or draw crowds but rather it will create dull and bland portraits of the beige hue that is my life. There is a certain level of depravity one must have to ever truly understand my actions. I have decided that the stories worth being told and the ones that go the most viral are the ones with the most emotion. Really think about it, those sad puppy commercials, Romantic jewelry ads, even those stupid smoking PSA’s all prey on your fragile emotions. I had ex’es that were less manipulative than those fucking ad’s. So, today I will explore themes of love, sadness, and fear thanks to the help of diaries I have read during my research. Now you may think what I am doing is immoral but my dear reader the emotions I speak of are nothing more than phantoms to me. I am older now, but I myself have died a long time ago. The author is dead yet the writer remains, even when I feel nothing this is all I know.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">So I have decided to engage in a bit of thievery, so many of the best films are based on real life. So in a sense I am just claiming my stories before those hollywood jagoffs buy the rights, I truly am a hero for the underground story tellers. I have found many ways to infiltrate a diary mostly through charisma, persuasion and trickery, but never by force. A guarded heart will never open, I would much rather prefer to find my subjects in the wild and befriend them with my intentions always being hidden. I give them a great time and I am sure to entertain and in the end I think both pirates get a good deal. The journals I have read in private have made me treat them better in public. Every insecurity is now an opportunity for me to grow closer, I am to be trusted with every secret and turn those weapons into crutches that they can walk with. Who cares if my comments are insincere if it made their day? Who cares about the methods I use to obtain my intel if it leads to a net positive? Even those who are critical of me will have a hard time denying my integrity to keep a secret. So why am I selling all those morals now? Well my dear reader, the best authors aren’t the ones on the bestseller list or the ones hosting book signings, they are instead ordinary people writing for no audience. I have read so many stories and quoted so many lines that have sliced through my heart like a scalpel due to their efficiency and precision. The best authors have jobs and live busy lives, they know what it means to make every word count, they wont fuck up a good script for the sake of some pointless cameos or call backs, they wont add convoluted plot twists to their stories to create a media frenzy to read it before it gets spoiled. These are people who live in the moment and in their most vulnerable they choose to reflect with simply the best word choice possible. And if you disagree with their word choice, then you are wrong for you have not lived in their shoes and could never convince me of their own emotions better than they could. I have decided to take their texts verbatim and share their stories for the public, for we all have the morbid curiosity to this taboo social contract. My dear readers, I did this for you.

    <p class="blog">“Oh my god, i love my girl so much she is just the best! Last weekend I went to the mall to buy her xmas gift. I got her a classic lego space set and a necklace with a dolphin on it. That is her spirit animal, and I know we have only been dating for 2 months now, but in truth it feels as if I had known her my whole life. I remember just yesterday we sneezed at the same exact time! My elbow could not contain the slight blush on my cheeks, as we both said “bless you” at the same exact time. My slight blush turned all red and we both cracked up. She is an angel and I really think I met her at the perfect time in my life. I wanted my gift to show how much she means to me. With her the world has color.”</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">I had to read tons of journals to find something palatable in regards to love, and even this still feels rather sappy. I am not one to judge though, the kid seems happy so I will let him be. I actually tutor him in mathematics, he is just some highschool dweeb figuring it all out. I never really talked to him beyond the numbers, but when he got a girlfriend in the beginning of his senior year, he began to be a real chatterbox. Truthfully I didn’t want to even read his journal, I hate highschoolers. I was going to find a tasteful mature entry but I have read about so many shitty bar dates that I considered going to an AA meeting myself. I think there is something charming about this kid and his life. Oh you should have seen how his eyes glowed up when he spoke of her. Maybe he is pure, perhaps too pure? No, I don’t think so. The day I found his “journal” was the day he left his binder behind my office. I didn’t notice until the end of the day when he had been long gone, so I decided to take it back to my home to prevent it from being stolen overnight. As I walked with the binder I accidentally had tripped on a piece of loose carpet in my shitty office building and all of his papers flew across the ground. My curse of speed reading had gotten the best of me and I was able to absorb much more than I could have ever wanted to know about this kid. The sappy passage you read was his beacon of hope in a world of dark pages that speak on isolation and bullying. I stopped reading as soon as I realized what I was doing and put his papers back in the binder and never spoke on it again.</p>

    <p class="blog">“The house is in foreclosure, and I have been out of work for three months now. I don’t have the gaul to face my family. When I took the kids to school today I had to remind them to cut the mold from the bread before eating their sandwiches. The one job I still have, as a provider, is one I am failing miserably at. And my poor wife, how do I tell her that our retirement fund is gone? The idea of working in my 70’s scares me enough as is, but the fact I sucked my whole family into this is the ultimate slash to my soul. No matter what, I must stay alive.”</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">I have no relation to the man you just heard. I found this journal in a lot of books I bought at a random estate sales nearly a decade ago. I paid 10 bucks because I saw some classic Dickens and Burroughs novels that I wanted for my collection. The Journal was just merely cramped in the end, just bent and beaten. The passage I just presented was the last written entry recorded in that journal. Strange how his journal was sold, if he was the one who had passed I would assume that they would have moved his journal from the book shelf. Or perhaps his family never knew of his own struggles let alone the journal, and just like that bent up book he himself covered and hid his true feelings from his own family. I may never know, much of the journal was unreadable and trying to decipher what happened to him will just lead me down a rabbit hole with no satisfaction.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">September 18th 2022</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">“I woke up forgetting what day it was again, not that it even matters much these days. The fog clouds me yet again and I am forced to reread this damn journal over and over again. I don’t know how many more times I can take his passing. I wonder if the pain of relieving it haunts me more than the pain of forgetting it. I am fighting this I swear, but I think it is time to let go.”</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">I used to volunteer at a nursing home, I found it to be a gold mine for validation and stories. I believe I got inspired to write at least 3 blogs during my time serving. The place reeked of ointment and nostalgia, I hated it. Yet I did grow a liking to this particular patient, she was lost yet happy until she decided to read her damn journal and like clockwork she would be haunted on a daily basis. Thankfully for her, I was able to make the decision to let go for her and as I signed out for the night I made sure to nab her journal. Did I feel good about it? No, but I knew she didn’t feel good about living in a loop. I checked back in the home a few months back while wearing his cologne and not even the scent triggered a memory. She was a changed woman.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">What have I done, my wine bottle is now empty and my heart is filled with nothing but regret. Am I so failed as a writer that I resorted to plagiarism and thievery. My morals are truly gone and I am left with solace. The real authors lived with pain and wrote only for themselves. Were they able to find comfort in the end? Sometimes, the kid was able to keep himself hopeful and was able to enjoy his victories as well. Our other two entries on the other hand are more up for interpretation. Are the writings any good if you can never express them outside the pages like in the case of the man? Or can what we write just be a reminder to haunt us like the woman? I have so many questions, but morally I feel as if I have opened Pandora's box upon myself. The human condition of curiosity is deadly and I am left with more answers than questions. The hidden complexities of the lives of people can’t just be argued in black and white categories even if you can find common themes. Perhaps I am the fool who played god in these people's lives. My judgment is just a passing breeze in the grand scheme of things. Do I read these diaries as a means to live vicariously through others because I think my emotions are dead, or am I just scared to experience them for myself again? It is easier to speak in the comfort of my own home than it is to act in the heat of life. I think I must wake up. I am not a saint and the stories I told today were stories that didn’t need to be told for they were already lived and my interpretation could never beat their reality. Perhaps to become an Author again I too must live my story and let reality be my writer. Only time will tell my tale, I just have to be there to hear it.</p>

  <h2>Making Vulnerable Art</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">Art to me has always been about expressing yourself and I think some of the best works regardless of medium are strongly associated with high emotions. Whether that be the highs of a romantic relationship or the devastating void created by death. You can always instantly empathize and connect with the art when you are emotionally open to interpreting it. Interpreting art and consuming it mindfully and emotionally is something I have written on multiple times already, but today I would like to talk about the process of making vulnerable art while also giving some examples along the way. I feel it is the hardest to create art when things are dire, but I would argue that for some people it is their only way to express and cope with their losses. So how do they come up with these pieces and what do they do after it comes out? Let’s find out. </p>

    <p class="blog">First let me say, everyone’s artistic process is completely unique and different. Some artist can never make dark themed projects, because when they are in a dark headspace they shut down their creative side, and some other artists when experiencing the highs of life tend to put down their artistic endeavors to savor their moments more. It is a wide spectrum of when these artists feel most inspired to create. Personally I am more prone to making art when I am feeling ambitious, I have only recently started to create things to cope with my darker headspace and it has been helping me, so for this blog I will mostly talk about my experiences on why I am writing this book, and starting other projects that will be more dark in nature.

    <p class="blog">This blog will be very personal actually, I am just giving a fair warning now. At some point I will talk to you like we have been friends for our whole lives, just go along with it. I think it is more interesting that way. Anything you don’t know about me just fill in the blanks yourself and use it as a means to relate to me better. Some of you who are reading this are my friends so I expect (hope) that you won’t have to do too much assuming. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">I got really inspired this week, usually I don’t like talking about my artistic process or anything I am making before it is ready. I think talking about such things will basically lead to you microdosing dopamine and then losing actual interest in finishing said projects because you get satisfaction out of talking about it instead now. I don’t want to be that guy. This is the only time you will hear of the things I make until they are ready and out. I don’t even care for rollouts. I don't have a fanbase anyways you can get to it when you do I don’t mind. So why am I talking about it today? Well Tyler the Creator recently released an album titled “Chromakopia” and quite frankly I am a huge fan of it. I think this is Tyler’s most deep, personal and emotional project to date. The layers and truths he reveals on this are as shocking as they are human. He is a man who struggles with relationships and bonds stemming from the generational trauma and now distrust in the childhood he once had. The idea that a relationship with his father wasn’t just some black and white “fuck this guy” situation but a more grey and complex one can sliced through my heart like a knife. The track “Like Him” I would argue is his magnum opus, the production is gorgeous and his vocals are just so haunting and perfectly accompany the imagery of him “chasing a ghost” as he says in the chorus. We build this song around Tyler just wanting to know if he even resembles his father, just for the ending of the song to reveal that his whole life he was lied to. It turns out his father did want to be a part of his childhood, but it was his mother who refused. There is no good or bad guy, everyone has their reasons, and the purpose of the album isn’t to judge anyone's character in such a simple manner. These are real people who have deep and complex emotions. I can’t say what the mom did was wrong, because I was not in her situation, nor is it my business to give her judgment when Tyler is the one who gets to decide how to take in that information. The message of the album and I think how Tyler copes with everything is to continue to live as your authentic self. The song “take your mask off” shows off the dangers and pains of living a double life, and it is with your authenticity that you can finally come together with your loved ones and grow just like on the closing track where Tyler's mom is proud of him and tells him to keep going. It’s a perfect album about the imperfections of family to me. 
</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">I am a fan of stories like these, irregular families are great things to have represented in art because many of us just can’t relate to that American Dream-esque life. Even back then when TV shows like the simpsons came out, it was accused of having immoral characters, but I think that fictional cartoon family has done more for family bonding then whatever bullshit sitcoms existed back then. This makes me wonder though, the simpsons is fake, but this tyler album was real. How did this happen? If you ask me, I think the seeds for this project began when Kendrick Lamar dropped “Mr. Morale and the big steppers” an album that also centered around generational trauma, relationships and dealing with the perception of the public. Both of these albums thematically have striking similarities, but stylistically differ heavily. Kendricks album focuses much more on individuality in my opinion. Contrast the outros of each album and you will see a stark difference. Kendrick is choosing to drop the things the public sees and choose himself, while Tyler is still figuring out what he wants out of life showing confliction throughout the song, which is why the outro loops perfectly right into the intro because Tyler himself is not at the next stage in his life where he can 100% say I want this or that. To me, the tyler album is more about saying “hey this is my life right now and we will see where it goes” while the kendrick album tells me “here are my problems and traumas and after living this life for a long time I am choosing to let go of it and not be who you want me to be” and you know what? I think both of these messages are fantastic and make for amazing bodies of work. You can have the same themes and still not be a derivative of the original and these two albums are perfect examples of that.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">So with the seeds planted what comes next, I mean isn’t letting the public know about this counterintuitive to someone who is so paranoid from the media? To that I will respond with my own experiences and opinions, these do not reflect what tyler has to say or feel, because like I said in the beginning every artist has their reasoning and process, I just want to explain mine. For me I choose to follow the idea that I got from a childish gambino album. On his 2011 project Camp the final track has a spoken word monologue where he says “I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody
      So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always
      Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them”
      To me there is a freedom in telling the world something, because I am not embarrassed about the things that happened to me, or the person I am. I love the person I am, like a lot, OKAY! (not that much but I hope the comedic timing translates over on the blog). What I am afraid of or embarrassed about is that someone can take away something from me that would make me vulnerable to the public eye, or that if a select few people know something about me, I have to worry if they should know it, or if they will tell or whatever. Secrets are stressful and they will eat you alive. Trust is a rare commodity that you should always cherish, when you really trust someone it can feel like you are talking to another side of yourself. But even having one person who you trust doesn’t make living with a secret easier because you are still fearful of yourself “slipping up”. I think it is easier to just get on a stage with a microphone and shout out all your burdens. And you will be able to receive all the reactions at once rather than being too scared to even reach for positive validation. When I finish my book, I don’t know what everyone's reaction will be, maybe fear, disgust, even anger perhaps? It is a story that will be well written for sure, but I am by no means aiming to please with it. I will preface by saying it is fictional but a lot of the topics pertain to my own thoughts and feelings. I hope the reaction to the book is that people can relate and take comfort in its themes and see the story as something to think about rather than to block out.
      </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">It reminds me of a conversation I had with my mom this week. I was trying to pick a movie for both of us to watch and we kept arguing about genre. She told me that not every movie has to be deep and I responded with my tangent about how art that moves you is special and I can enjoy a dumb movie from time to time. I usually prefer things that change my outlook on life. My mom responded by saying that it is strange that a movie can do that to me. I said it is art in general that can move me, it is like how people are religious for me it is art. Well we just ended up watching American Dad and The Bear because of our conversation. Now fast forward to the weekend my mom calls me talking about a song she heard that moved her and I was happy that she felt the power of art. The song and why it moved her I will not discuss, but seeing other people react to art like that first hand to me as an artist just makes it all the more real when I do put my heart into something, people will recognize it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">I think true art is always made with a purpose (money doesn’t count) and to me sharing my darker thoughts and stories is liberating. I am able to move forward in my life and put a story out there and I will wake up the next day no longer haunted by the perception of being perfect. I can be honest with everybody including myself and start to build real relationships again. To tell the truth the book I was writing before, I had to scrap because I no longer related to it’s message, but over the summer I started writing this book about someone who worked at an office job who feels there is no point to anything in life anymore. He feels isolated by his success and chooses to feel a distaste toward the world because all he ever knew was to climb higher. I only wrote the first chapter, but I had it all outlined and in the ending he would die, because at the time I had no other idea how to get out of that mindset other than death. The story was hard to write and there were some points where I would physically feel ill writing such things, and if I was to complete it then it must have meant that there was something horribly wrong with me. I am happy to say I no longer fully feel that way, but the experiences and thoughts I had while writing the first story are inspiration for my new story and even in fiction it is hard not to bleed it with doses of reality. I think those who know me will be able to identify things about the story to my own life, coincidental or not. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">To conclude I hope everyone reads my book one day, and when an artist makes something that is clearly personal and vulnerable. Please give it the respect it deserves, not just for my work but everyone's. Oftentimes we forget that there are real life people who make the things we consume and to categorize things with number ratings and shallow genre names to me is sick and dismissive of the greater purpose of art. I think when reviewing such bodies of work you can be critical of them. Sure, not everything is perfect after all, but always come at it with some form of empathy especially if you choose to critique the themes. Thank you and have a great one!

  Now if you ask my mother, she will tell you I indulge in too many dark films. This was a comment she made to me after we watched “Midgnight Cowboy” without knowing anything about it. And in all fairness, if I had known how depressing that movie was, I would have put on something else for my movie night. The film follows a gigolo who moves from texas to new york to make more money and become the biggest in his industry. The movie takes a depressing turn when he ends up broke and homeless, his only friend is a shady type and the movie just has a very depressing tone. I personally really enjoyed the movie, it’s a great dissection of masculinity and the power of having male bonds that revolve around deeper things than money and girls. I loved the movie and I would recommend it in all honesty, the camera work is stellar and the editing was truly ahead of it’s time. The film has a disgusting setting but the colors are anything but unpaletable, the movie just works and is one of the most impressive films I have seen from the 60’s. Now what does “Midnight Cowboy” have to do with violence? To answer that question, let’s take a step back… all the way back

    <p class="blog">From the beginning of humanity we have always had the desire to communicate times of both suffering and joy. With communication came the advent art, initially it was rather brute and straight to the point, with cave paintings and engraved rock art of animals in the area. The prehistoric was meant to portray an obvious message of showing what food is in order to ensure survival throughout generations. Our brains where only developed so far as to only care for survival and reproduction, so it was only natural for our artistic ambitions to lag behind that. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">As society began to form so did our brains and our desires. Humans where for the first time valued by not how many game they can hunt but rather what specialized function they can bring to a greater community. With this came the advent of full time artists, people who desired to create art that reflected their society. This early iteration of ancient art is still rather simple compared to where we are now, often times you will see themes of god, religion, power, sex and wealth. These newer ideas go beyond just survival and reproduction and it was the first time in history where a drawing could generate an emotional stimulus within a person, whether it be fear, pride, joy or sadness. Art was only beggining to gain emotional power.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Religious themes remained a strong force in the art world up until the bobunic plague. The plague created new fears and perspectives on morality and death. It was estimated that 50-60% of the population was dead in any given European city. The much death and trauma is argued to be a contributing factor to the first renaissance, as well as the rise of naturalism and more secular ideologies of thinking. Those who survived the plague where left with substantial trauma that even their faith could not fully heal. The human mind craved more and the artist where able to provide that comfort. Author Giovanni Boccaccio wrote “The Decameron” which is also known as the Human Comedy. The book follows 7 women and 3 men hiding in a villa and avoiding the plague all the while they tell stories to pass the time. It is like an anthology of sorts where each story spans different topics and tones. Some stories in the book are erotic, some are funny, and most importantly some are critical of society and specifically the catholic church. This was huge and the church fought hard to make sure the book would not survive. The church even went as far as burning the book in the bonfire of the vanities, which sought to destroy sinful art. But I believe it was the churchs censorship that created even more traction for the story amongst society and lead to what would fully be recognized as the renaissance later.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">It took a dark and critical story to get the ball rolling and make people not only find solace, but also find inspiration to do more with their lives. During the plague we have also seen an uptake of paintings revolving around death and imagery that is rather scary by nature. The artists where just creating what they knew, and to this day it is some of the best visual representations we have of the tragedy of their time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Now let’s jump to today, because quite frankly I am not qualified to be an art history teacher. If I was I would have also included a tidbit here about art during the great depression, as it is one of my favorite movements in the American art movement. Specifically the tragic look of “nighthawks” that can still resonate with a viewer today. But this is what I wish to speak on, resonation. With sad or tragic pieces of art it is viewed as a theraputic exercise to understand and appreciate the messages behind the “canvas” so to say. As the timeless and iconic Sade Adu said in 1992 “sadness in songs is positive because it brings it out of you; it brings the sadness out. It’s not that the song makes you feel sad, the sadness is already there. The song just makes you recognize it”. So it isn’t the art that creates the emotions from you, but rather it exposes them, so what does that say about violent media?
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">This is something I have been struggling with for the past year. My once innocent enjoyment of things like slasher movies, and manga is now something I feel rather self conscious about. As you know I am extremely pro-palestine even if I wasn’t palestinian myself I would still be pro-palestine because GENOCIDE IS BAD! It is the reason i created this website, the old website I had was a zionist company, I never gave a rats ass about coding, but I had such disgust from my support going to genocide that I decided to build this up myself. Now with me being an educated person on the facts, it is very easy to assume that I have seen intense, gruesome and real footage of some of the nastiest and ungodliest crimes in the history of humaninty. Seeing the suffering people I have the same blood too has taken a mental toll on me and it has made me deep down question why I do the things that I do so many times. So why do I like these films so much?
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Many detractors will argue that violent movies will make you desensitized to real life violence. And to that I say, maybe? Quite frankly all the studies and cases I have read don’t make a strong stance on the idea of desensitization. According to a 2016 medical journal from J Youth Adolesc, those who watch violent media experiance lower elevations of blood pressure when viewing violent media compared to those who don’t usually watch violent media. So, yes I think you can to a certain extent go “numb” to tv violence, but to anyone who has seen the difference between a real tragedy and a bloody slasher will know that even a million horror movies can never make you overcome the image of real human death. I know I am desensitized to horror movie violence, I recenetly watched terrifier because I have a friend who won't shut up about the franchise and in all honesty I didn’t feel an ounce of sympathy or care for the charachters being slaughtered. I mean I know it’s fake, and my indifference lead to my enjoyment. I was watching fake violence for once, and in the chaos of the gore I was able to finally look at a bloody mess and not feel sick to my stomach for once. I liked the film, because it allowed me to utilize escapism through violence.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">I have seen real violence and I know that there is nothing gratifying about laying hands on another person. I never even seek fights on my drunkest of nights, I think that violence is the ultimate tragedy of humanity. Yet it is in our human nature to crave it. Primal instincts to hunt still exist within humans deep down, and I think that is why slashers do so well. They play out more like an animal documentary than an actual film. The humans are like gazelle that we watch on the screen until the killer pounces unnaounced like a lion and grabs a kill. These primal instincts are now infused with our modern society and the films are used to sensationalize things like sex, drugs and alchohol. Do these movies ever make a specific point about society? No not really, I’d say scream does with it’s more meta approach, but even then it’s shallow at best, we just want to see the kills. The sex and drugs are just meant to make the audiance feel more connected to the humans in these films. Nobody wants to be that lame killer who has no girls, or booze. Even when we root for violence, we are still happy when the gazzeles can run away from the lions once in a while because deep down we want to relate to prey more than predators.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">So why do I think these films should have a place in society? I think even if we lack empathy for the humans in slasher films, it doesn’t mean we lack empathy for real people. If anything I am more aware personally of what real violence looks like because I am so desensitized to fake violence. Seeing a real person in trouble will never make me numb. The over the top and near cartoonish violence of the films don’t mirror reality because it is simply too painful to even capture. 
    </p>
    <p class="blog">Now am I saying watch nothing but horror films now? FUCK NO. watching too much of any genre will change your perspective and world view. You may not turn into a psychopath if you watch nothing but horror, but you will turn super annoying. Think about folks who are disney adults, or hardcore metal heads it’s just cringe don’t just enjoy one thing. I also think that horror movies are best enjoyed either with people as a fun adrenaline filled night at the movies, or once in a while on a particularly spooky night. You need to set yourself up to get the most enjoyment you can out of these things ya know. I will it is your life watch what you want, but in my experience as a horror fan if you wish to watch only horror films then at least have a wide pallet of horror. Slashers, thrillers, paranormal, monsters, hell even comedic horror just mix it up so you can stay on your toes it keeps it fresh in my opinion and there are a lot of great classics in the genre. My favorites in the genre have always been trick r treat or silence of the lambs but you can never go wrong with your own personal go to classic.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">What about other violent stories aside from slasher films? Well I have just recently read the first 3 volumes of berserk and god it is gorey. Anything you can image is probably in this manga. It is one of the heaviest and vile things I have read and enjoyed. Why do I enjoy such a story? For me I think violent stories like berserk help give us a protagonist to follow who lives in a reality that is closer to ours compared to many other fiction heroes. Seeing a world that is worse and seeing how our protagonist walks through it, to me is actually inspirational and enticing. I read through those volumes so fast because I was dying to know what would happen after each pannel. I have never had so much interest while reading before, and I hope in my future of reading this manga I will get to understand guts better because his character will help me understand myself and how I want to be in the chaos of life.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">All in all, don’t overindulge in any one genre. I do love violent media, but I also love comedies and romance. I still watch one piece and listen to sade. I don’t let the darkness consume me like a hot topic goth. I just choose to enjoy everything, and try to find the message or simply just the beauty behind art. Because lord knows it is hard to find it in the world sometimes. I hope the people of Palestine have their hope still wether that be throught their faith, dreams, art or even their children. I think whatever keeps someone motivated will always intrinsically bring a net positive even if it is just a stupid movie. Thanks for reading and free Palestine, Congo, Yamen and Lebanon… Fuck the occupation!

  <h2>Coping with Hawk Tuah</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">
  And no, I am not suggesting oral sex will heal your trauma.
</p>
<div>
  <p class="blog">This has been a strange year in terms of celebrity culture, to say the least. In the mainstream, it feels like “A list” star has fallen from the graces of the people. Cornerstones like Drake, The Rock, Diddy, Beyonce, and even Mr.Beast have all fallen from the graces in the public eye this year. With distrust in celebrities at an all-time high we have seen the rise of some new stars such as Kai Cenat, Ishowspeed, and the topic of today's blog Haliey Welch aka “Hawk Tuah girl”. What makes the Hawk Tuah girl different from the likes of Kai and Speed is that she doesn’t try to be famous. I don’t watch Kai or Speed, but in the clips I have seen of them I can tell that they put a tremendous amount of effort into their content as well as being naturally entertaining. I think Speed is the top 5 most entertaining people alive right now. Hawk Tuah girl lacks any of that, she became famous solely from a shitty tiktok taken of her on a drunk night out. To many, she represents mediocrity and slop that has been flooding the internet for many years, but to some, she may also represent a hidden envious dream we all have. Today I will be examining the rise of Hawk Tuah and the three ways we can view her fame. We will first discuss her rise and give background then we will be using the lens of hate, irony, and hope to dissect what her fame means to artists and non-artists alike. I hope you got some water because it is going to be a long one today.</p>

<!--Insert the rest of your blog's text here!-->
    <p class="blog"> In June of 2024, a random YouTuber was asking drunk women a series of nasty and NSFW questions in regards to “moves” in the bedroom. Now I can go on a rant about how this behavior is just flat-out deplorable and disgusting, but for the sake of the narrative, we will focus on what Hailey Welch said in her interview. Actually, before I get to that I do want to rant about this format, street interview videos are so weird especially this style of asking visibly inebriated people such embarrassing questions, I am so glad I have never been approached on a night out by a dude doing a TikTok because I would have been done for if I ever wanted to be seen in a professional light again. Sorry for the sidebar but I think it is an important aspect of The Hawk Tuah Girls story that I will circle back on later. So back to the story, the interviewer approaches a drunk Hailey and this is where her life will forever be altered. He asks the question “What is a move in bed that makes a man go crazy every time”, she would then enthusiastically respond “Oh you gotta give 'em that hawk tuah and spit on that thang!”. The biggest irony of this encounter was that the question was originally intended for Hailey’s friend, but either by coincidence, fate, or sheer determination, she found a way to take the spotlight and deliver a line that was heard around every office space in America. The meme took off instantly, especially with millennial white men, some on the conservative side of the spectrum even took the meme as a safe haven from the “evils” of pride month. For the entire month of June was conservatives proclaimed that Hawk Tuah defeated pride month. Twitter user @iAnonPatriot said, “OMG.. The LGBTQ crowd is mad because the Hawk Tuah girl is stealing their attention during pride month.”. For the first time in American history, straight men have talked about sucking dick more than gay men, happy pride indeed. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">The following months featured Hailey selling merch, appearing in clubs, and even speaking on a couple of podcasts, this is a subtle foreshadowing to “talk tuah” which would come out in Late August. Her presence online wasn’t inherently political but she was sure to dog whistle to her conservative male audience by being into things like Elon Musk, and crypto. She even made a statement saying that Twitter is her preferred news source compared to the mainstream media, which is only a profound statement for idiots and neo-nazis (not that there is much of a difference between the two). One thing I found interesting about her though was her website 16minutes.life, I am not sure who picked that name but the name itself is insanely powerful to me. It is a play on the line “15 Minutes of Fame” Hailey here is proclaiming that she will stretch her fame for the rest of her life, is a 16th minute even possible? It hasn’t even been a year yet and quite frankly I don’t see her status on long lasting. Her story feels like a modern-day Icarus, a girl trapped working a regular job and living a normal life who is suddenly forced into being a meme off of one drunk video. She had no choice but to fly and capitalize, but even once she could have escaped from the trenches she still chose to fly closer to the sun and double down on her image. She tasted the fame and wanted to climb higher, unaware of the potential danger, or maybe she knew there was nothing to go back to. I will save the rest of this ramble for my conclusion, but I want you to think about if she even had a choice as we continue through this blog. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Today we see Hailey start her own podcast talk tuah, the podcast itself is rather unremarkable just her and her friends talking about… ummmm sex? Okay, I can’t lie I haven't listened to the podcast I tried but sitting through a minute of it made me want to surgically remove my ears so I would never hear again (I would also be easier to draw too :P). But, the point I am trying to make is the podcast doesn’t really matter, what is important to note is the rise of her new “fans”. After seeing Millenials laugh at hawk tuah for a month straight, many people from younger generations realized how stupid of a meme it was. The new wave of hawk tuah enjoyers are laughing at the absurdity of it all, how a girl who talked about sucking dick has become a celebrity overnight is inherently hilarious. I think it is really funny especially when her podcast reached the top 3 on Spotify. It was truly spectacular to witness such a thing, and many people like myself had no other choice but to laugh at the chaos.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">We are now in a confusing area for the Hawk tuah fandom. How many of her fans are real fans, and how many are ironic? As for the ironic fans, how long can you enjoy something ironically before you either get bored or deep down enjoy the content? I for one am not a hawk tuah fan nor have I ever pretended to be one, I just thought the story was hilarious and for a week I said hawk tuah because it pissed off my friends. So now let’s take a look at how we can view her fame and what direction it will take us mentally. Starting with hate, the easiest emotion to feel on the internet these days.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Hating hawk tuah is so easy, anyone can do it. Whether it be her original fan base using the dumb meme to spread hate or the fact that she constantly grifts to that audience it is just so easy to not like the meme. I think most people don’t even hate her for that reason though, the average hater of hawk tuah doesn’t even know that about her I bet. I think most of the hate actually stems from envy. In both the artist and non-artist perspective we can see how they may feel betrayed by the sudden fame of Hailey. For an artist, it is easy to get mad at an algorithm that pushes and encourages mediocrity. What is the point of being good if it just alienates me from the general public? The artist's internal struggle typically revolves around fulfillment versus recognition. Artists deep down want to be recognized in some way, no matter how hard they say they don’t want it, but they will refuse to sell their values short. Of course, there are examples of artists selling out, grifting, and just being desperate but those are examples of the need for recognition overtaking the need for fulfillment. That is why it is a battle, to reach an equilibrium as an artist is truly so hard especially if you are ambitious. The ambitious artist who truly hones on their craft will feel betrayed by society propping up talentless acts, while they slave away for minimal results. What will take a lifetime for them to achieve only took Hailey one night, and even if they refuse to admit it, they are jealous of it I guarantee it. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">To the non-artist, can hate hawk tuah as well. “It should have been me!” they may say, the fact that Hailey didn’t even say anything profound is just the salt in the wound. To put it bluntly, sucking dick and “spitting on that thang” are really really REALLLLYYYYY common, it’s not even that cool to make a man go “crazy”. The fact that she can say such an answer and not have to work the next day can drive normal people mad when they dwell on it. I was surprised her moment was so popular amongst older people, perhaps it was a way to cope. To quote Twitter user @kishdontmiss “She fr said Hawk Tuah and now has a whole career” he later replied, “I was at work mad as fuck thinking about this earlier today”. I think a lot of people yearn for an opportunity to become famous without the talent and training required, the fact that it COULD have been them is a painful reminder to some. Hating hawk tuah doesn’t say anything about Hailey as a human but rather about the society we live in that allows mediocrity and degeneracy to flourish. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">The next lens we can view is the lens of irony. I think this lens is more popular amongst young people and will play off the idea of mediocrity rather than resent it. Ironic fans of Hawk tuah view her in a satirical lens and as I mentioned earlier laugh at the absurdity of her story. Artists have turned her fame into an opportunity for them to garner attention in an ironic twist, this is by using the hawk tuah branding and language to create art pieces of their own or making memes about the meme. My favorite one is the “walk tuah metro station” I think the message is dope, and the video trend is rather funny. Other artists have drawn Ms. Welch or even made songs referencing the meme. Instead of holding it envious, they use it as an opportunity to not just laugh at the absurdity of life but also to capitalize off it. They know the source material isn’t funny, but that is what makes it even more impressive when they can make something palatable off it. For non-artists it is the only way for them to view it in a comedic light, the tiktoks and use of Hawk Tuah isn’t exclusively for artists anyone can make and say those things. Making it a trend homogenizes its new meaning and shows unity amongst younger people. “The world is absurd but hey at least I'm not the only one seeing this shit” right? Laughter is the best medicine even unfunny things can be funny if viewed in the right light and I don’t see the evil in having a good time. Just don’t make your entire personality based on ironic enjoyment of things, you need authenticity to remain grounded and confident in what you do actually like. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Lastly, I asked myself, “What is it like to be an actual fan of Hailey?”. The fact of the matter is, that there is a non-zero amount of true fans of hawk tuah. Scientifically it is nearly impossible for EVERYONE to be in on this joke except for her, she must have actual fans. I want to put myself in the shoes of what a fan may think of her. This is the lens of hope and optimism, Hailey welch is popular because she was able to capitalize off a funny clip on the internet and make personality based content that people can enjoy. I for one, want to believe that humans are inherently interesting and that we all have the potential to garner and generate followings despite our actual talents. If we have a personality then surely people will enjoy us. I want to view hawk tuah as a story that says anyone can make it in life. I want to be an optimist about it because frankly, the alternatives are rather depressing in my humble opinion. So does hawk tuah have real fans? The answer is most likely yes, but can I tell you the percentage of her audience from real and fake, and the answer is a big fat NO. Despite that though even if most of the room laughs at you, you still have people who will laugh with you, and I think that would give me comfort personally. I would enjoy making art still even if most of my audience doesn’t get me, as long as I have a core following no matter the size I will be fulfilled. I want to believe that there is a fulfillment to it all, that not everything has to be some meta-sick joke. I am tired of laughing at things when I can enjoy other things. It broke my heart seeing that new KSI song, I think the song is terrible to be frank, and I am not sure if he made the song as a joke or not. But it is obvious to anyone on the internet that KSI is capitalizing off the memes and irony of it all, he entertains the bad reactions and the rage streamers. It is tragic how the only way for him to push a song is to make it an ironic joke. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Is this what it feels like to be in the late stages of irony? Do things come out just to be made fun of? What about those who do enjoy the podcast or even the song? I am sure those people exist, and as for the “artist”, what do they truly feel deep down? Was the podcast and song just a cheap cash grab just to garner as much money off recent fame? Or did they originally intend these things to have substance and purpose? I want to believe that there is a purpose to this other than money and jokes. It may be naive, but I want to feel optimistic, about the world sometimes. I think it is disgusting that KSI is feeding into the ironic stigma of his song, as an artist I would never stoop so low even if I released something bad, I would defend my work as it is a part of me. Hailey has yet to respond to the idea of irony in her fandom, and I don’t think she is aware of it. Her Twitter is an echo chamber of her real fans and I think she never will address the inflation of her following being from ironic enjoyment. To conclude I want to hope that there are people who do enjoy things non ironically even if it is things I think are dumb like talk tuah podcast and in the thick of it. I think it is insanely depressing if we can inflate things into the mainstream of ironic enjoyment alone.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">As for my final thoughts on the matter. What do I think of everything as a whole? I think Hailey Welch is a victim of fate. From everything I have seen of her, I notice that she is very opportunistic, from her iconic video to all the branding and appearances she has made. She is smart in terms of chasing the spotlight. But I think she should have never gotten famous, or at least famous in the way that she became. I will say something that we all should know (at least I hope), you can’t consent when you are drunk. Consent whether that be sex, contracts or even approving likenesses, requires both parties to be in a state that is not incapacitated. So follow me here, why do we have men with cameras asking drunk girls what is the freakiest move they can do to a man in bed? The more I dwell on this the more disgusted I get frankly, so to be honest I think Hailey didn’t have a choice in the fact of becoming the “hawk tuah girl”. I don’t think she would want to go back to her old job because her identity has been forever altered without her consent. She would have gone back to the office and everyone would have referenced the viral video, even grocery shopping would have been hell for her. I think the best thing for her to do was to own the identity because people would have felt a way about her regardless just from a clip. I think it is powerful that she chooses to wear her sexual identity with pride. Originally it was a man who dragged it for the whole world to see, but I think her deciding to wear it with pride is rather empowering. What makes it even more impactful is the fact that the men of this society don’t get the judgments that women do when it comes to sex. Nobody was calling the interviewers weird creeps, nor was anyone calling for men to be slut-shamed when they collectively cheered at the idea of getting “hawk tuah”. If she never made her own brand then the only people who would have profited off her sexuality is MEN, and her owning it was her taking that profit and power back to herself. I am not saying she is some sort of feminist icon, but I am saying that female empowerment isn’t one size fits all. She isn't the new Gloria Steinem and nor does she claim to be, but she isn’t afraid of who she is and chooses to wear it on her sleeve and for that I there is good to come out of it all. So to conclude I am not a fan of Hailey Welch, but I wish her the best and I hope that she does feel fulfillment with what she does, I don’t think she truly had the option to choose this path, but is here by chance and is trying to stretch her 15 minutes of fame beyond. Best of luck Hailey, and for the rest of the readers thank you for hearing me out. Have a great night and a gorgeous weekend! </p>

  <h2>Everyone’s a critic</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">
      First of all. Yes, I am still retired, but I pay 20 a year for this website so I will use it to rant on here because frankly, I don’t want to annoy my friends at 4 am. I usually tweet out my frustrations, but if my tweets get less than 2 likes then I feel like dying, so to save myself the embarrassment I will put my thoughts out on my website where I am the only one who can yap on here. I think I just like hearing my voice, well my typing voice. Anyways today's topic? ah yes, EVERYONE'S A CRTIC, and quite frankly I hate it. </p>

    <p class="blog">As of late, I have filled my nights with movies, I have always found cinema to be comforting. It is so interesting to me that a literal team of super-talented people from all fields can come together and make a story that I can truly relate to and connect to. Some films I have watched recently and highly recommend are “Midnight Cowboy”, “The Good, The Bad and The Ugly”, “Robot Dreams” “Jackie Brown” and “Joker Folie a Deux”. The last one I listed will be the film I wish to highlight regarding tonight's topic. Joker Folie a Deux has debuted with “mixed” reviews to put it nicely, and when I watched it last night I was just truly confused as to why this film has such negative reviews. I left the movie theatre with goosebumps and a mind full of ideas and feelings about the movie and what certain things meant to the overall story. Since the film is new still I will not discuss any spoilers, but for my no-spoiler quick review, I will say this. The Mise en Scene of the film is excellent in the visual storytelling of what Arthur is going through internally. This is especially known in the many musical sequences which I will say have fantastic set pieces and the fact that there are recurring motifs and props that play an important part in the sequences reward the observant viewer and give the film such a natural and layered progression. Speaking of progression, I would like to mention the acting in this film is just phenomenal, Joaquin Phoenix was even better in this film compared to the last one, and the script allows him to explore Arthurs' many emotions and mindstates. It is impressive how despite Arthur's vast emotional range in this film, it all still feels very consistent with his character. The supporting cast does an amazing job as well. First and foremost Lady Gaga was hands down a star in this. Her musical numbers will be looked back on as stunning, but for me, it was acting that truly stood out. She was able to be both alluring and unsettling and it fit the character of Harly so well. The rest of the supporting cast was phenomenal too, but I don’t want to spoil everything here. In regards to story and progression, I came into this movie not knowing what to expect, but I loved the direction they went with the characters and I found the direction of the story to feel truly natural due to the acting and set design I described previously. Overall I really loved the film and will be rewatching it soon enough, for me it is only 2nd to Dune part II this year. 
</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Now what do the critics think about the movie? From what I have read they find the mere existence of the film to be confusing and thus it is bad. I just find that to be bad logic and it is something that is going to highlight a bigger issue I have been seeing in the art world as of late. Critic expectations versus The artist's vision is a battle as old as art itself. Every piece of art that comes out now will always have a “bar” to compete against, whether that is the artist's older work or pitted up against the work of other contemporaries. It is only natural for the mind to wander over to comparing, especially if you are going to be investing time into art, why would you choose an “inferior” piece? But here lies the fallacy, if the artist's new work is a drastic departure from the previous, the general audience will still pit it as if it was the new version of the old work. This is what I call the square peg in the round hole method of reviewing. Critic expectations and mindsets are biased by the artist's previous works and it stops them from viewing the new art through a new lens. For Joker 2, it seems a gripe many people had was that the film was “boring”. Now I can see where people are coming from with this. Joker 1 and 2 are to be viewed through drastically different lenses for me, for the first film I best enjoyed it from the lens of a character study of a man who was abandoned and deprived of nearly every basic human need. It is a test to see how much the human spirit can endure before resorting to primal urges of revenge, the highs of that film are false hopes, and even the Joker's biggest victory is shot from the perspective of him contained by justice in the end. The first film is about the degradation of a man to an animal, it is gritty, disgusting, and raw. As for the sequel I view it from an opposite lens, the Joker starts the film as a caged animal but longs to truly become human, yet he is viewed through a lens that will always keep his reputation as a violent beast. It is a movie about the longing for humanity at its deepest and most conflicted. If you come into Joker 2 expecting crazy shit to happen, then you will be truly disappointed. But if you pay attention to how everything is set up the movie will naturally take you on a journey and guide you through and complete the character of the Joker. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="blog">Okay, so what if you watch the film from a different lens and you still don't like it? Then you are 100% entitled to that opinion and I will respect it. If you gave something a try and it didn’t resonate with you, then you have every right to share that opinion. As long as you format your opinion as an opinion it can be as silly or shallow as you want, I don’t care. My problem lies when people try to pass opinions as facts without having any evidence to back them. I just saw this one YouTube video from a very big YouTuber reviewing Joker 2 titled “The Joker sequel is a disaster” and his closing arguments were simply the movie was boring and to only watch it if you want to take a nap. What a stupid take, and it pisses me off too because he views this film as a diss towards the first, when it is a natural progression of the characters. He never uses any real criticism other than saying things are boring. My biggest gripe he had was that he said the courtroom scene was pointless. The courtroom scene is ⅓ of the movie run time and is without a doubt filled with some of the most important scenes and lines in the whole film. You don’t have to legally like the scene but if you think the movie would have been better without such a crucial scene then you are objectively wrong. Instead of giving out boring and brain-dead takes of removing a scene, you can instead offer an exciting and innovative way to change a scene. Even if I disagree with a change I can see where they are coming from and understand their lens better. But if you delete a scene it just shows a flat-out refusal to adjust and understand the art you are consuming. For me when I hear people say to remove scenes from a movie it sounds like a child saying to remove onions from a burger. Removing the onions will drastically alter the taste and the texture of the burger and without all the chef's intended ingredients you can not rate his burger in my opinion. Now if you think the onions don’t work then offer a substitute to the chef, maybe you need to caramelize them? The caramelized onions would work better with the BBQ sauce on the burger while the raw onions are too distracting to the taste. This is a conversation and we can agree and disagree on. Removing the onions is simply an ultimatum and unless you can give me a good reason as to why the onions must be removed other than you not liking onions, then I will view it as a childish taste. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="blog">So what is my conclusion in this mess of a ramble, (Jesus Christ it is so late I'm tired as hell). WORDS matter. What we say is important and when giving criticism or praise it is important to have discussions and understand the “why” of things. Even in personal opinion-based enjoyment, you will find yourself to be a bigger fan of things if you have that “why”. Often our vocabulary is filled with idle and filler words that truly just paint a picture of contempt. How many songs do you listen to “bang” “go hard” “slap” or whatever generic statement you can come up with? If I counted all my “bangers” I would have enough for an orgy hahahhahaha. Look if you are on aux or at a party PLEASE use these words, if we are lit let's be stupid it’s okay. But if you want to talk about music or art in general, and want to feel actual fulfillment then take more time to understand your feelings on a piece and articulate yourself. You may find yourself not only understanding things better but also appreciating things too. Go outside and enjoy art, change your lens, and even debate your contemporaries. It is all healthy and fun, after all when it comes to art what you get out of it is what you put into it. CIAO!

  <h2>Art: the biggest lie I’ve ever told myself</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">
  Hey, I know I’m retired, but I figured a tweet and an IG story wasn’t a fitting goodbye to the people who did care about what I created. For that I am sorry, The sentiment I had there is still true, but I feel I owe you a better explanation. I received a few messages when I disappeared for a few days and I noticed that people were concerned for me, and for that, I am also sorry. I will be okay, and I am more concerned with getting better and making things right rather than giving up. I feel like I have lost what made “me” feel like “me”. So today I will tell you, the biggest lie I have ever told myself concerning not just art, but life itself.

    <p class="blog"> My art journey truly began when I was 8, I had a love for making comics and scribbling. Those school notebooks I had were rarely filled with anything of educational value but instead, they were filled with caricatures of my friends as these stupid comic book characters. I was taking Karate then, and on the bus, I had a friend named Ian. What I remembered most about Ian was that this kid had these chipmunk-like cheeks on his face, and one time on a speed bump I saw them recoil and I thought it was the funniest thing of all time. This started my comic obsession where I would give him the powers of super stretchy cheeks and he would fight villains. As I learned more about his life story I added elements of that into my book, such as his crush being the main villain / redeemed sidekick in the sequel. I was mostly inspired by Adventure Time, Star Wars, and Indiana Jones (despite never seeing either Star Wars or Indiana Jones, I just guessed the plots from the Lego games). The comics were stupid but in class, I would make them to show my karate friends after school. It was dope, my brother was my biggest fan then and he still thinks those comics are good (blinded by nostalgia). I was happy.

    <p class="blog">In eighth grade, I got my first phone and opened an Instagram account. In my first few posts on Ig, I had a gimmick of posting these fake inspirational quotes and then every once in a while I would write a short story in my captions and tag my whole class. I was so annoying and had no idea how to use IG. I didn’t care about an image and rarely posted myself, I always thought what I posted said more about me than any selfie could ever. I no longer hate posting myself on IG, but it has to be a damn good reason tbh (and yes a hard fit is a damn good reason). I enjoyed writing the stories though and the classmates I tagged would leave comments gassing me up. I was rather liked for my talents at storytelling, despite my stories being a paragraph long and having the complexity of a Taylor Swift song at best. I was happy.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">In my sophomore year of HS, I became a meme rapper. It was stupid and cringe. I hate the music so much, this is where I began to fail in life. I traded my humanity for this character of something I was not. Meme rap is stupid, but the way I was doing it was insulting to the art form and I should have never done it. It wasn’t funny, and I had no reason to be doing that. I love rap as an art form, even when I was making meme rap, but I failed to understand the true implications and value of music as an art form. I did it all, stole beats, used rhyme zone, and did bad impressions of 21 savage adlibs, it was just bad and tasteless. I had friends who gassed it up though still, I know some of them were low-key embarrassed, but I became a character locally and I enjoyed it despite my grades suffering. Despite everything, I was still happy.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">College I decided to get real, I wanted a job, and to be viewed as a respectable man, not a cartoon character. This is when I started doing some of my best work. My music was better, my videos started having an artistic vision and lastly, I got back into writing. My writing is the thing I love the most, it is easily my best asset as a creative. I was making so much stuff, yet as each year passed I felt I was losing something within myself. I reinvented myself successfully, but I must confess, I was happy and I could have been happy.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">The lie, I believed was that art would make me happy, and the better I was at art the happier I would be. I used to believe that all this time I was doing this for me, but now I have come to realize how selfish that reason truly is. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">The truth is that art is a powerful tool for expressing yourself, but is useless without other people. Art cannot be created in an eco-chamber and only existed due to the context it was made in. I can’t still make art if the reason I made it is no longer true. I didn’t want fame or fortune, I wanted to feel seen. My best days as an artist were those where I would speak one-on-one with other creative people. I enjoyed sharing ideas and seeing the people I grew up with become amazing artists who I can genuinely say are some of my favorite artists right now. It was a privilege truly, and this summer it was something I took for granted. I was obsessed with myself, that I forgot that it was the people that made art worth it.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">They say all art is political and I agree, inherently it is a statement on human evolution and the fact that we can spend years making things is truly a blessing and a sign that community is a powerful tool that gives us more freedom than individualistic lifestyles. I was privileged and I had all this time to make art when there are people who don’t have that time because they need to eat, or a place to sleep. For that, I believe that 95% of “self-made” artists are bullshit, you can’t be an artist by yourself there is always someone to be thankful for. It can be a teacher, a friend, or even a YouTube video, but the fact is there is always homage to be paid. I have failed to pay homage, and despite being the best I have ever been artistically, I now lack purpose for it. I have always made art I enjoyed, but my enjoyment came from making people I care about happy. Art is a way to share ideas, but without people to share it with, I would just be insane. I no longer wish to create art because it doesn’t make me happy without the people I care about.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Author note: I was inspired to write this after hearing of one of my old high school classmates passing away. My condolences are to the Woolsey family. I am terribly sorry for your loss. Please keep those you care about close and never be afraid to ask for help if things get rough. It takes bravery and courage to ask for help, I know for myself I couldn't muster the strength for help when  I needed it most and I lost many things. I must stay thankful for what I do have and try to rebuild better. Rest in peace, to those who are no longer here today and I pray the family is filled with nothing but strength during these trying times.</p>

  <h2>Hope and Optimism in Philadelphia </h2>

  <br>
  <p class="blog">I highly recommend watching the video first, but you can still read this blog without it. Now that we have passed the disclaimer, I want to talk about my trip to Philly and what it means to me internally. This summer has been the summer of literature for me, I am by no means a book connoisseur, but having a library card and a few minutes to kill from time to time has helped me get through a few books so far. Of the literature I am reading, I find the beat generation of writing to be something I truly gravitate towards. American classic fiction has never been my favorite truthfully, the classics just don’t move me as much as more modern novels. I think it was mostly due to a lack of truly interesting characters. Sure Huckleberry Finn is an icon, but what the hell does he have to do with me? This is a similar problem many of the beat authors had.   </p>

    <p class="blog"> What makes a beat novel so interesting to me is the fact that most of them are vaguely disguised autobiographies. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is based on Hunter S. Thompson's trip to Las Vegas as he covered a motorcycle race. The motorcycle race was something he covered in an unorthodox way, thanks to being on a massive bender. He would later turn in an article “highlighting” the race, but it was really just a collection of his thoughts and observations around the race more so than the race. The paper went from a 250-word photo assignment from sports illustrated to a full-blown novel. This was the creation of Gonzo Journalism, where the reporter creates a personal narrative around an event, rather than objectively recording. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Aside from drugs and alcohol, another common subject of the Beat era was the idea of running away in search of freedom. Many authors of the time, like us today, found the classic characters to represent a farce. They knew that the version of America they represented was either long gone or never even existed. These men sought out their own meaning in this country that has left them hungry and unsatisfied. Many of these men will carry that dissatisfaction with them for their entire and often short lives, as many of them would end up committing suicide either by addiction or gunshot. It is such a shame that many of the authors who inspired the hippie movement, Rock n Roll, and counterculture in general ended up never giving a satisfying ending to the one story they never finished. </p>
   
    <br>
    <p class="blog">The story of your life, contrary to popular belief, is something I believe you can shape and mold just like any other story you write. Matter of fact, I find myself having less control when I write my own fictitious works rather than living my own life. When I write fiction, I often times find myself with hands that move on their own as my characters develop their unique minds and consciousnesses that are separate but still connected to me. Writing good fiction is equivalent to having a child, in the beginning, you can shape it up to an idealized version of yourself, but whatever weaknesses you may have as a person will end up reflecting on both your art and your children. In fact, you can live your whole life lying to the world, but it is the pen and blood that will always see through a facade. This is why I find writing my book to be nauseating at times, I don’t want to talk about things in my book, but the characters I created choose to do so and my hands are no longer my own. I find my writing style in that regard to be very similar to the Beat Generation, we both wish to find meaning in existence through means of travel and exploration, but I do not wish to have my story end like those before me. Today I will dissect and talk about what the Beats got wrong.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Traveling to Philly earlier this month changed my perspective on the purpose of travel. I went to Philly only expecting a cheesesteak and some funny clips for a bootleg Anthony Bourdain show I was making. Little did I know that throughout the process of filming, I just couldn’t help but notice everything around me. Not in an overstimulating way, but more so in a welcoming way. It felt like seeing color for the first time after living life in greyscale, my eyes enjoyed every second of it and my other senses followed suit. In my video I kept, yapping about the 5 senses, but I do mean it. Opening myself up to experience what a city offers made me find a new version of myself. I was at peace, and because I could feel the outside world, I could feel the world of emotions within. I didn’t even do anything too “crazy” in Philly, just a few public parks, a museum, Newgrounds HQ, and some food, yet I felt so stimulated despite all my previous adventures being grander on paper. This trip made me realize that many of my trips I spent with idle eyes. Sure I could see, but for most of my life, I felt as if I had never used my vision to its fullest extent.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">We take many things for granted truly, the fact that I am able bodied and minded is a true blessing that I have taken for granted. Those who aren’t able to experience everything, try to make up for it by maximizing what they do have. It is a shame that it takes for people to lose something so vital to hold dear what they have always had. I took so much of what I had for granted, the thing I took forsaken the most isn’t a sense though. It was my memory, you can have the best eyes in the world but if you never create memories then everything you see will always be void once it is over. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">The power to create and cherish memories is something that I believe the Beats have failed to truly capture. Oftentimes on beat adventures, they created a false reality due to an influence of drugs and alcohol. I am by no means saying every memory should be a perfect recreation, in fact, a memory is more special when you can create a narrative around it. Your favorite memories are rose-tinted even if you were sober because life is filled with euphoria and joy that can alter your perception far greater than any other drug. The beat's use of substances wasn’t a way to alter memories, but rather to numb them. Oftentimes you see people who spend thousands on a trip and go on a massive bender just for them to not remember anything afterwards. I find that to be pointless to forget such spans of time. Now I am by no means advocating for a straight edge lifestyle (i'm a saint I know), some of my favorite memories involve me drinking, and smoking… not so much, but I truly don’t see the evil in it from time to time. However, despite being able to have fun and create memories with such substances, I should not confuse them for catalysts. I don’t need to drink or smoke to have a good time, I can be all peachy before I grab a brew, but if I am already feeling good then hell yeah I’ll take a beer why not right!? This is what Beat’s missed out on, oftentimes behind their adventurous writing lies panic-stricken and empty men, who truly have never experienced what they speak of. An eternal loathing and yearning for the gift they will always reject. </p>

    <p class="blog">The gift of hope is what I have finally received in Philly. Sure the food was delicious, and the art museum was gorgeous. But I honestly would have not cared as much if it wasn’t for the feeling of hope and optimism I felt when I explored the city with a true friend. As a Palestinian-American I find myself falling into the abyss of hopelessness. I truly do feel a survivor's guilt, why do I live in a country that has treated me so well, while also supporting the death of my own people? I feel as if I am tied down by my own identity and I lack the ability to truly enjoy anything. Everything comes at a cost, the phones we use are products of slave labor, the taxes we pay to fund a genocide, and the people we vote for truly don’t give a fuck about us since every politician is a shill that can be bought and swayed to the highest bidder. I truly do hate this country despite my privileged upbringing. I hate so much about the things I can’t control, I wish I was born different truly. These were the sentiments I brought up to my friend Said on the trip to Philly. When you look at things from a global scale you will only see the worst in humanity. Our societies and structures are just mirrors we build to reflect our beliefs of power and superiority above nature. The world we created is entirely self-indulgent of the idea of human superiority, a truly dangerous idea, because instead of living a life of love and benign connection with nature, you choose to live a life of being “the best” at the cost of making everything else worse. The global scale will not change until we change our reflection, I was able to find my hope again through travel and noticing the power within the community. Communities are as important as they have ever been during these trying times. People who support other people without the need of mega corporations and monopolies destroying any semblance of love is a feeling that I have lacked for a while. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Philadelphia is called the city of brotherly love, and I immediately found out why. The city is founded on the cultural idea of small businesses supporting each other. On the same block where I had my cheesesteak, I was able to literally walk to the supplier for their bread, meat, and cheese. This is something unheard of in the DMV area, where you can get massive bulk orders from Amazon to keep your fridges stocked. Hell, even the packaging and aprons are from these little shops just across the street. All of these shops are family owned and there is a pride in that to me. Seeing people support people for generations creates communities and culture. With communities being created, then it is only natural for kindness to be birthed. Kindness (as per my last blog), is the best trait I think a person can have. I was blessed to see kindness not just from my friends, but also complete strangers. In the video, you will see Ivanallmighty give us a tour of Newgrounds. He didn’t have to do that, but he did because he noticed that we are fans of the website. It is gestures like this that make me realize that hey, I am not alone and if I want to see change and have a brighter outlook on the world then I first need to change myself and then my community. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">This is what I urge you to do, keep hope and hold on to optimism. People may call you delusional, but delusion can only exist when optimism isn’t rooted in anything. Make your beliefs steadfast and put them into something greater than you. Believe in art, education, god, humanity, kindness, anything you feel strongly toward and practice the mindset religiously. The Beat’s saw the world but could only see a reflection of themselves, I want to see the world and it be a reflection of love. Keep hope, and lead change with passion and love. The people of Palestine have kept hope, so what is stopping me from doing the same? Things will get better because I will make them better from the ground up.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Do not fall into hopelessness, in the city I saw many hopeless people. It filled me with sadness, to see such depravity, from the junkies in the metro station to the robberies I saw on social media. It does make me sad that people have to view this as their only escape. These people aren’t hopeless because they do drugs or steal, they do such things because they are hopeless first. It is in the worst of society where I see my reflection, I could have ended up just like any of them if my circumstances were different, so I shall not judge. I don’t want people to live like this, so instead of judging and building up a castle of superiority, I instead try to help and build others up in order to not just better them, but for them to become lights in their communities. Keep love for those who are hopeless for they need it the most.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">To conclude, don’t just use your senses, instead experience them and explore how things make you feel when you create your memories. The Beat’s in the end never fully got over their own reflection and fell into hopelessness and being tragic examples of tortured authors. Enjoy life and bask in the smaller things, because those are the things that are pure and rewarding, and believe in something greater than yourself to avoid a life of hopelessness. Go find a place and explore it, until next time may your adventures be wild, and your stories be grand - Mousa</p>

  <h2>Choose Kindness</h2>

 <p class="blog">
  If you have been keeping up with my lore, you should know that I have graduated college and have sense been working a marketing job. The gig is good, it keeps me busy and the marketing team in the office is filled with some of the coolest guys around. Truth be told, I would have not taken that job if it wasn’t for my liking to them based on my past internships and experiences with them. During my first two weeks of work, I have started to notice the differences between being a student and being a true adult. My perspective on life itself has changed so drastically. </p>

    <p class="blog">The idea of depravity seems far more familiar to me these days especially compared to my youthful and carefree nature as a child. I spend my days after work thinking about what angle my life would take. It feels like I have already lost some things in me, by being in the place I am today, but today I am here to argue a case for kindness. The thesis for my argument today is that kindness is the ultimate weapon for fighting the monotony of life.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="https://preview.redd.it/what-does-she-know-about-being-a-good-person-v0-7qhzu4mgan3d1.jpeg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a6f06a350f3244c0af7bd7a46b7a80890e46e5fc" style="width: 90%;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
   
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">This blog is inspired by a Twitter “trend” I have seen recently, where people argue the pointlessness of being a good person and doing the right thing. I believe that it’s not only mentally rewarding but also practically rewarding to be kind. To start let us take a look at the arguments for not being kind.</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">The first argument I see is that being kind will only put you behind your “competition” in your career, as well as your personal life. This argument is irrelevant to being kind. Ambition is a great trait to have, but you can be ambitious in getting the things you want while also retaining your kindness. If you feel like you are required to do things that you deem as “wrong” for an opportunity at a job or relationship, then in due time you will grow to resent the decision you made no matter how enticing the pay or person is. Unless you are a sociopath then you should eventually feel remorse for your actions. And for those sociopaths, if you don’t feel remorse then you will feel consequences. Just look back at every gangster movie in pop culture, spoiler alert none of them have happy endings. </p>
<br>
<p class="blog">That is enough preaching, now it is time to get more personal. Being kind is something I don’t do enough, it is easy to not be an asshole, but to go above and beyond in being kind is a true muscle that I want to grow. To be kind is a true virtue that I want to achieve. As the world goes deeper and deeper into depravity, the bare minimum will only become more admirable. The charm of human kindness is something you lose track off, when you are always in a rush. This is my message to tell you to stop and smell the flowers, and while you are at it pick em and give em to someone who you care about. The things you thought mattered are only soured by the rancid taste of loneliness if you were to spend your days in wrath. One must choose the fruit of kindness, for it is a tree that will continually bear fresh fruit, especially in a world where the trees of wealth, health, and well-being can always rot and crumble.</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">So this section goes out to you money chasers. Trust me I am just like you, most of my mind is focused on the everyday dollar and what I want to blow my next paycheck on. I tend to get blinded by the shine of cash that it blinds me from the darkness in my own soul. I question the very thought of it’s value all the time, but it is ignorant to think it is useless in this capitalistic society. Money makes the world go round, but if you treat money as a tool to measure the worth of a person then that is an easy way for me to know we will never get along. I find greed to be the nastiest antagonist to kindness, the fact that people genuinely put their wealth over the wellbeing of people is just heartbreaking to think about. It is even more heartbreaking to think that these are the people running our corporations, banks, and governments. The greed that lies within these people is something that is debated all the time. Are you human because of it? I am of the thought, that greed can only make you no longer human. I find greed to be animalistic in a sense, that only bleeds insecurity and lack of trust. If you have money then you should combine that blessing with the fruit of kindness. Money is a tool that only magnifies one's character. I used to be very frugal as a person actually. This happened because I lent a so-called friend some money back in High school. He would end up ghosting me on the pay back, and it only lead to me to not trusting anyone, especially with money. I recall talking to my uncle about it, he stated that it was a blessing that he ghosted me. My uncle's theory is that people like that can only do you a favor because for the low price of money (which is something you will make back) they bought themselves out of your life. “For 50 dollars, I never have to talk to that mother fucker again” is what I remember him saying. Hearing that changed my entire perspective on money. These days I am far more okay with giving and loaning to those I care about, and I recommend that if you have money and are stable then it is something you should do as well. Even if you don’t have friends in need, then donate to a charity, buy someone a meal, or do something. Money (even if it doesn’t mean anything to you) can help someone a long way, so use it to unite instead of divide people.</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">The next type of kindness is one that I think is even more important than all the money in the world. The kindness of humanity is something I find to be rare. Often times people wear kindness as a mask to achieve their ulterior motives. Men are only nice to hot chicks, Kids are only nice when Xmas is around the corner, and The service is always better when you sit in first class. This is just transactional kindness and is therefore not true kindness. Kindness has no reason, it just happens. It is just as pure as it is magical, something that can even make me contemplate the idea of a higher power or purpose greater than my own selfish desires. In all honesty, I hate when someone is nice to me because it makes me feel like an asshole. Just yesterday I was at a concert, drunk as all hell. I started starring down these random girls' chicken tenders, something about the alcohol made me think I was in dire need of food. I started joking with my friends about how good that chicken looked, and I even joked about stealing it from her. Obviously I would have never stolen a random girl's chicken (i know i did the bare minimum wooohooo give me a medal!), but I was joking out loud and I made a terrible mistake of being too audible. The girl ended up snatching the chicken in fear, and at that moment I felt like a huge asshole, I had this girl stressing over the chicken in the middle of the concert. Now to add to my current shittiness she turns around and OFFERS ME the rest. You know how cruel this fate was. I am the so-called writer telling you my dear reader about kindness, yet it was some random person at a concert who was able to prove the point to me, better than any of my words could ever. Now I refused her offer of the food, not because of a trust thing, but because I simply felt unworthy at that time, I apologized profusely and told her thanks for the offer. Kindness is a true cheat code and when you get hit with it, then it can elevate you’re own desire to be better.</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">Here lies my last point of the night. Kindness is contagious, but only the bravest can start the chain. I want to believe in the good of humanity, so I will present this idea to you. In this life, nothing is guaranteed. You can be hot, rich, smart, or anything else you view desirable, but one day all of these things will fade. Never mistake the gifts you were born with as characteristics, instead use these gifts and fill your character with kindness and positivity. It is moments of kindness that can create a lifetime of joy. Just try it, start with a small act, and see how far such little effort can go. Thank you for reading my blog and have a great night.</p>

  <h2>Marketing Network Event Notes & Reflection</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">
  Recently I have been blessed with an opportunity to speak to many people in the marketing industry. First, I would like to thank VCU and every teacher, faculty, and professional involved in ensuring this happened. I had a great time and I learned so much. In this short blog post, I would like to give you my reflections and main takeaways from the event. </p>
     
   <center> <input onclick="change4()" value="Show More" ID="button4" type="submit" class="collapse4" style="cursor: url(custompointer.png), auto; position:relative; top:50%; margin: 0 auto; display:inline-block; width:30vw;height:30px;color:white; background-color:black;"/>
 

<div class="container"
    style="display:none;">
<!--Insert the rest of your blog's text here!-->
    <p class="blog"> The first point to make was the importance of networking, currently, my heart lies on moving this summer, so hearing people give me real advice on how to meet people and connect has helped build my confidence in getting myself out there more. I enjoy this process of my life a lot and meeting new people and making connections is paramount to my growth. You can’t just only connect with your peers, you need to also connect with more experienced people to find mentors who have been in fields you want to be in. The experience of time mixed with the ambition of youth is a balance needed to achieve greatness, not just in the corporate world but in life as a whole I believe. With these connections you must avoid comparing yourself to others, you shouldn’t be the smartest person in every room you walk into, that is a sign of insecurity if anything. Get used to not being the best because it will only give you a hunger to learn and cooperate with others. Lean on mentors and learn as much as you can. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
   <p class="blog">Speaking of learning, this is the next point I wish to address. We are lifetime learners, and my life as a student will never end even when I graduate this May. Learn and get certified in software like Excel, Tableau, Photoshop, or whatever the industry standard is for your career. Software is always coming out and you need to be able to adapt and learn new processes because the truth of life is that we are always looking to maximize efficiency so you can’t afford to not adjust to the times. Google has a free night school called “D&AD Shift” where you can get online certifications that will look good on a resume as well as help you learn new things.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Another thing to note is that creativity is important everywhere, even in things like data analytics, you need to think creatively and tell a story out of the data you have. For example, if you see a trend in one thing losing popularity, it is not enough to say “that thing is trending downwards in popularity”, because guess what? An AI can say that same exact thing now, and it is scary to think about a robot taking out a big part of the job market. So in order to rise above AI, you need to master “soft skills”, these are skills that a computer can never have like speaking, presentations, creativity, and personality. You need to stand out not only with your brain but also with your personality now. This is why creativity is so important. You aren’t different anymore, you are instead someone who stands out!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">The last conference I attended was a selling one. Marketing and sales have a close relationship and I think through sales you can learn a lot of those “soft skills” that marketing doesn’t ever really teach you. In the sales panel, I learned the importance of not only upward mobility but also horizontal mobility, many sales positions are just ways to get your foot in the door to land that marketing job you want so badly. I will consider applying for sales jobs because the mentality they give you is something I truly respect. In sales, you will learn the value of self-motivation and ambition, due to the commission-based pay and personality-driven challenges.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Overall I had a great time and learned a lot, I would like to thank VCU again for this amazing opportunity. If you would like to connect with me then please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or send me an email. I am excited to continue my journey and I hope that what I learned today is not only helpful to me but helpful to you as well.</p>

  <h2>Confidence is reassurance, not entitlement</h2>

 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">
  Good day to everyone reading this. First I would like to shout out myself for making it, I am the best this is my website, this is my blog and nobody is doing it like me in 2024, I am soooo go—<i>*INCORRECT BUZZER SOUND*</i>. Okay now for real though, hello everyone thank you so much for reading my blog today on my new website. I am still very much excited about everything right now, but today I would like to speak on the dangers of not understanding what true confidence is. </p>

    <p class="blog"> As of late, I have been moving a lot in both my professional and creative spaces. It has gotten to the point where I wake up and instantly go to work. This has been a great flow for me in the past and it helped me build myself up again due to my previous experiences of hopelessness that I expressed in my previous blog. For me working makes me feel good, when I make progress it is hard to not get excited. If anything it is good to get excited, but I started to get this rush, a feeling of superiority.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">When it comes to art I have a fatal flaw, when I start getting things in place I genuinely start to feel like a god. Like I need to throw water on my face to chill out because I get so hyped about myself that it blinds me from areas I can improve upon. I know this flaw is not who I am, because of how much I hate that side of me. I needed to understand what true confidence is. To me, confidence is reassurance, not entitlement.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Before we understand reassurance we first must contextualize confidence as entitlement. Confidence as entitlement lives solely in the ego. You are confident because you think you deserve praise due to your own greatness, You chant mantras of being the “G.O.A.T” but you average 31 monthly listeners</p>

    <p class="blog"> Shameless self-plug aside, this mindset is dangerous because it forces you to rely on outside validation as well as generates a false sense of superiority. The truth of the matter is you are not the G.O.A.T and the next time you drop there is always a chance that nobody will be moved by it. It doesnt matter who you are because it can happen to anyone and everyone. So is it still confidence if it only makes you more vulnerable and limits your own growth? Of course not, this is just a loud insecurity.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">I have fallen in that trap a plenty before, and it just leads to an inevitable cruel taste of reality. Well, it is only cruel if you believe in the delusions of grandeur your mind generates for you. This is why I have decided to practice what true confidence is. The confidence in self-reassurance changed my entire perspective on everything and has made me enjoy what I do again in every field.</p>
    <br> 
    <p class="blog">True confidence has to come from within and is built around the belief that YOU can build yourself up and improve. This true confidence doesn’t blind you from flaws but instead makes you more open to hearing criticism and working on yourself. Often times the most confident people are the quietest. You have nothing to prove when you are confident and make every move for the sake of what you like. I am now a confident creator, in everything I make I am a fan of it now, I know it is flawed and I can take criticism because I love my work so much that I just want to get better.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">This is why I created my chop wood carry water series, my website, and my blogs. I no longer fear perception, if anything being perceived will only make me see my own flaws. The only way we can prove our existence to ourselves is through the lens of others. I exist because I’m here, but I know I’m real because I am seen. Whatever reaction I get from being seen doesn’t affect me because of the strength I get from being seen. To me, that is the ultimate reassurance. I have the power to put myself out there and it doesn’t matter what happens because I feel good about it at the end.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">People are important to the creative process and you need a good balance of those who are fans, and those who are critical of you. But to take you’re strength from their perception will ultimately lead to a dangerous crash out.</p>

    <h2>Cinema Outside the big screen</h2>

   <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
   <p class="blog">
    As of late, I have been a huge fan of films and movies. I am borderline a film buff, the only difference between me and them is that I don't pay for letterbox pro hahaha. the word cinematic means a lot to me because to me it means larger than life. and as someone alive, I can say that being larger than life means it is HUGE. The art of being cinematic in movies is hard enough, but to translate that feeling into other art forms is just jaw-droppingly impressive. Today I would like to shine the spotlight on some of my favorite cinematic pieces of work that aren't movies. </p>

      <p class="blog">This might be my favorite thing Fujimoto has ever made. This short one-shot story is a real-life love letter to films in the form of a manga. The manga opens up with a kid named Yuta who is filming his mother's death. It is a slow and emotional opening. Fujimoto uses this technique of repetition in manga panels in order to create this film reel effect that just adds to the feeling of it being a movie. Another thing that is cool is the use of motion blur and the camera quality in this section compared to the rest of the manga. It is all so very interesting and makes this manga feel more authentic. take a look at this</p>

      <p class="blog"> And boom we made it to the ultimate reveal, this was a film competition. the explosion was just part of the movie, and we get back to reality. but this does not stop the cinematics from existing as Yuta continues to film in the real world as well. with these next images please notice when the in-universe camera starts recording </p>

      <p class="blog">The manga continues to do this through its run time and just gets wilder as we get deeper into the plot. I only wanted to speak on the first few pages because I do not wish to spoil anything. Please go read this, it is my favorite manga ever and I am so glad Fujimoto continued to use the repetition motif in Chainsaw Man Part 2, i love how cinematic his work is.</p>
      <p class="blog">2) Music</p>
      <p class="blog">Music can 100% be cinematic, as of late I have fallen deep in love with the idea of a concept album. a concept album is an album that focuses on one central idea and theme. these albums tend to follow a character as they go through a journey and we find the start and end of the album to be drastically different in terms of mindstates.
"Mr.Morale and the Big Steppers" is a great example of a concept album with a character. the main theme of the album is generational trauma as well as external pressure. Kendrick uses himself as a character to make something that is both personal and relatable. the first disc on this project focuses on the problems Kendrick has. the first track serves as a perfect introduction to the elusive Kendrick, we learn that he has been going through something over one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five days and follows it with the phrase "be afraid". this builds the listener's curiosity. the following tracks are aggressive and brutal in terms of subject matter, N95 and Worldwide Steppers are about Kendrick's insecurities and vices. N95 Kendrick asks "Where the hypocrites at" as he uses the track to criticize the general rap community for fake activism and overall lack of realness. this goes into worldwide steppers being a personal confession of Kendricks's lust addiction. this humanizes Kendrick and makes us realize that Kendrick is also feeling guilty about the reason why the world is that way. Diehard is him pleading that is not too late to fix himself, but when he is faced with the solution of therapy he sends a rebuttal of his not needing into therapy,  as the next track "Father Time plays". This next arc of the album has rich spirit, celebrating what Kendrick has gone through and how he is thankful that he is who he is. This keeps him distracted from his problems. We are ultimately hit with a wall where we see that it is all a front, "we cry together" is an example of how his view of women and past trauma has changed his view of women and relationships. The final word on "We Cry Together" is to stop tap dancing around the conversation. Tap dancing is a motif throughout the album and is most prevalent on tracks where Kendrick is directly talking to the listener. "savior" on disc 2 is a great example of the tap dance motif. Kendrick gives the listener the truth of not idolizing these rappers (and LeBron) and after every statement comes tap dancing. It is a way to tell the listener to pay attention and not to tap dance around the truth. the 2nd disc overall is titled Breakthrough and it circles around Kendrick realizing the trauma and problems in his life are something he needs to tackle. "Auntie Diaries" is a story about him recalling his experience of being insensitive to a trans family member but growing up and accepting them. "Mother I Sober" is a track where he finally comes to realize that he does need help, the sober truth is a powerful one. "Mirror" is the outro and Kendrick comes full circle and realizes that he is not the listener's savior, and wants to focus on building his own life. I love this album so much man, it grew on me heavily because I truly can relate to some of the things he says, which is something I could never really say with his music.</p>
      <p class="blog">3) Video Games</p>
      <p class="blog">Video games have come a long way since being about virtual tennis, we now have virtual tennis with silly characters :D. but in all seriousness video games are a valid art form and can be a great tool for someone to experience a story. I can pick a lot of great examples of great cinematic games, but I think my recent favorite video game of mine would be "Stray". the game sort of fell into a strange realm of being overhyped, but it is talked about for the wrong reasons in my opinion. I like playing as a silly cat more than anyone else I know, but we fail to see the bigger picture and true beauty of the game.</p>
      <img src="https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/16162533/SEI_118880616.jpg?crop=16:9,smart&width=1200&height=675&upscale=true" style="width: 90%;
      display: block;
      margin: 0 auto;">
      <p class="blog">what made this game feel so cinematic to me was its amazing score and use of lighting. exploring the game world felt fun and rewarding even if the gameplay was really basic. Games like these are often criticized for being style over substance, but I personally find a lot of enjoyment in these short experiences where everything in the world has a purpose rather than a huge open-world triple-A mess with bugs and stupid shit. I like a short game, i am a grown-ass man if I am playing a game alone best believe it is something with a dope story. It's hard for me to really explain the beauty of stray without just recommending you to play it for yourself. it is a really short and replayable game that I can tackle on a sick day so I recommend you play it in one sitting too.</p>
      <p class="blog">4) Life</p>
      <p class="blog">Life is the ultimate piece of cinema if you make it one. There are moments in life that feel so grand and meaningful. This one is the hardest feeling to capture, but the sweetest one to feel. In life, there isn't editing and countless teams working to give you the perfect lighting, dialogue, and emotions, sometimes it just happens and when it happens naturally it feels truly ethereal. Of course, since these moments happen without planning it is our job as people to pay attention and live in the present. today is the best gift we can ever receive and nothing about it should be taken for granted. This was a lesson I had to learn for myself, in my damn near 22 years of living it feels like I have seen a lot. The truth is nobody truly knows my full story even those I'm closest to, I can just wake up and drop a truth bomb on my family and friends if I so choose to do so. I find that aspect to be empowering personally, people find me charming and captivating for the person I present myself as more so than the story that lies underneath. With that power and knowledge I bestow though it can come to hurt me, for a while it felt like nothing was exciting me. I hate college in all honesty, I am just too locked into getting this degree to complain about it. I became someone who only seeks satisfaction from my stress, because in my mind in the end it will all be worth it. If I wasn't working then I was dying, this is how I felt. Hanging out with friends, and making art, it all felt pointless to me for a bit, mentally I just had leaving on my mind. I have recently come to realize that, my old way of viewing the world was just a delayed suicide, I was losing the joy in my life because I have truly felt like I have seen and done it all. I was bored, but I was bored because I made it boring. my constant worrying about the future led me to never enjoy the present.</p>
      <p class="blog">Mentally I had to change; I decided to take reading and enjoying art into my life again. With these inspirations in my life, I started to notice parallels, after all, life imitates art. "What do I mean by this?" you may be asking. Well allow me to explain with an analogy, I used to view my life as if I were an anime character in a shitty shonen anime. I didn't even view myself as a main character I felt like a side character whose only two plots are working or the stupid "filler episodes" where I would do something with my life that truly didn't affect me in the slightest. Filler arcs for me were things like playing video games, consistently sleeping, drinking, and just being a degenerate. My character didn't grow or change as much the work I did just funded the fillers leaving me back at 0. I felt a void in my soul, I would justify my filler arcs by stating "Oh I worked so hard I deserve this" not realizing that said fillers are the reason I go back to 0.</p>
      <p class="blog">Now I view my life as a director, and whatever I make is my choice. Being a director allows you to dictate how your own story goes. My pain from working isn't just what I am about, it is instead development for me, and I reinvest that pain into motivating myself to grow and mature. Classic tropes of storytelling like the hero's journey are something you can and should apply to your life. it is a journey you will go on when facing anything in life, and when you anticipate and plan out how your story is then you can find true enjoyment in the process of getting to the end of enlightenment. You are the director of your life, so give yourself a direction and enjoy every step of the process because it is these trials that will make you better than you were.</p>

      margin: 0 auto;">
      <p class="blog">This is why people don't find life cinematic. We all make goals and have dreams but we fail to plan the steps in between. I want to play the piano but thinking about practicing it makes me want to die, this was a mindset I used to have, and it made the world feel all the more cruel and uninspired. The mindset is you need to chop wood and carry water. That means you need to enjoy the process of becoming great. Find the beauty in practicing that piano and contrast it with the hero's journey to plot your progress. Figure out why you want to be great and let it motivate you, when you have a purpose everything matters, and when everything matters that is when you have a cinematic moment.</p>
      <p class="blog">So next time you are feeling life is dull, just look around and realize 1) am I where I want to be and 2) how can I change. once you set that plan take one last look around, look at the colors of your life, and the sounds, and contrast them with movies you have seen and you will find parallels. Same with your growth this is your training montage in real time, and the payoff is the rewarding climax. Once you reach the end of that arc, it doesn't mean your story is over. Remember you are the director and when you are ready it is on you to start your next project. So be sure to enjoy it all</p>

 <p class="blog">
  Despite my disappointment in some albums, I found many new albums this year that I genuinely love. If some of these albums dropped in other years they might even be my AOTY for them, so ranking them this year has been hard. For this list, I am ranking off my personal enjoyment of each album, so I don't expect everyone to agree with my list, but that is what makes music fun, I enjoy talking about what I like far more than what I don't like, I also enjoy hearing what you like as well, even if I don't have it on my list I am curious to know what did yall spin this year. anyways ramble out the way let's get into the list</p>

    <h2>10) Genesis - Peso Pluma</h2>
    <br>
    <br>

  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	Peso Pluma undoubtedly had one of the biggest years for an artist in terms of blowing up, but numbers aside I would like to spotlight his album. Genesis is a phenomenal album that combines ballads, urban and cartel-influenced music so well that the album gives off a rich texture filled with culture and passion. The track "Lagunas" is my favorite, it's an emotional and somber ballad about him missing a woman that he had to split from for the sake of both of them, In the chorus he talks about how in his mind he likes to think that in another universe they got together and were happy. Other tracks like "Prc" have great energy that just makes me want to dance, the music feels like a live recording in a good way. the way the band is mixed in with the vocals, as opposed to the vocals feeling on top of the instrumentation.  it's something you will get when you listen to the music, the energy just translates so well without the need to be overproduced and that is definitely his strongest attribute. I highly recommend this album, it might even be higher on my list if i spoke Spanish tbh, but as someone who is not fluent in the language, I can still say I really love this project.</p>

    <p class="blog">	I was going to gatekeep this one tbh, but that wouldn't be right because I found this album from a friend posting it on their story. This is a Japanese art pop record filled with ambient strings, psychedelic keys, and relaxed production, all these elements collide with the calming and even somber vocals really well. This is one of those albums that feels like the album cover and I think that is my favorite thing music can do, other projects on this list also do this really well as well, but I will get to those later. I really don't know any of the lyrics but the vocal delivery on the last track is just cinematic, it's absolutely gorgeous and feels like an emotional climax to an album that takes you on a journey from sunrise to sunset in a small oceanside town in Japan. I like to think the last track is waking up from a dream, or maybe entering a new one, maybe it is a metaphor for death and that's why the album cover is so fuzzy like a fading memory. despite it being over you can still feel it inside you still. You can never really lose a memory if it changes you in the end. but i could be 1000% wrong here and the album could be about hot dogs for all i know, I still love this project. </p>

<h2>8) l3ft 4 d3ad - Hi-C</h2>

  <p class="blog">Hi-C is an artist you either love or you hate. I personally think his music goes insanely hard. This project has Hi-C rapping at probably his peak, I personally like melodic Hi-C more like on the Lonestar mixtape, but I still really enjoyed l3ft 4 d3ad. D3us 3x is a great track the beat is just so hard and Hi-C raps with such confidence that whatever he says sounds hard. Parano1d Hi-C takes a shot at Diamonds on my dick and actually destroys him he said "Pushing 30 tryna fuck on a teen got exposed on the gram whole world know you a creep" and "I can't pass her to you, you give hoes STDs". I love it when an artist doesn't rock with pedophiles cough cough (A$AP Rocky). Hi-C is just hard asf man, i really love Hi-C music, I went to the grocery store today to buy Hi-C drink just to feel more like him.</p>

<h2>7) Metropolis - Kahlil Blu</h2>

  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	Metropolis is the 3rd album from Kahlil Blu and it is easily his best work yet. This album shines in its versatility 22 songs but they all got different sounds. The title track is a great example of his talent, the beat starts off with this great piano sample and he just starts rapping the flow is tight and the chorus is mad catchy, then the beat switches to this pro era type boom bap beat and he slaughters it too. there are other types of music too, jersey club in "NO TIME" and "ANNOYED", Alt-rock in "MIDNIGHT MAN" and Rage inspiration in "Memory". Overall the variety is dope and he self-produces his stuff too which just adds to his uniqueness.</p>

<h2>6) Lovesick - Don Toliver</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/50/Love_Sick.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	Don Toliver is an artist that I never really gassed up like at all, like i fw his first project and what he did on "Moon" is still generational so when he dropped his new project i was not too hyped at first, especially since i found his last album to feel just like expensive sound. to me he always made music that sounded good but never really said anything. This album though I was really surprised, the main theme of this album is relationships the ups and downs of it, its mostly just lust though in all honesty, but its an improvement for sure. As for the music mannn I love this project Don Toliver varies his production and gets acoustic on some tracks which is a welcome change, he lets his vocals contrast with the production instead of sounding like another part of it. "Leathercoat" is a great song he does this flow around the 2-minute mark that is just so smooth, "Bus Stop" is a jersey-inspired dance track with Brent and it is just as fun as it sounds, and "Encouragement" is just a really smooth closing track Don sounds very charismatic and it really feels like a victory lap for him. Last but not least I need to shout out the best song on the album "Go Down" which interpolates tisa koreans backseat and Don's vocals over that beat just feel like a perfect match and Don was so real for showing Tisa love.</p>

<h2>5) Loreseeker - bbygoyard</h2>

  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	Bbygoyard dropped 3 projects this year, but this one is easily his best. Loreseeker is a great listen, I love the radio-style presentation of the album plus DJ Smokey's tags are just funny. This is not to take away from the songs by any means though the soundscape of this album is intense, "Now I've Become Death" is a drum n bass song that goes insane in the car, "Save Urself" has these guitars that just bleed in the mix and Bbygoyard has such a spiteful delivery that the song just feels evil in a good way. I'll say my favorite song is the final track "So Much for a Pleasant Goodbye" has elements of vaporware, shoegaze and rock, and it creates this just momentous and emotional closing track. It is very impressive how great it sounds actually especially if you come into the project only knowing him for his funny tiktok song.</p>

  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	Originally this album was number 5 for me but I read an article saying Richie from "The Bear" had this album in his top 5 THINGS of 2023. top 5 THINGS btw not ALBUMS, but THINGS like that's hugeeee so I had to revisit this project, and I saw the hype. when this first dropped I didn't even like it for real. It took me until August to get the album and once I got it I just loved it. This is a real-life Rap/Rock album and it really bangs. the first 2 tracks flow together so nicely that it feels like one song and they both hit hard. The third track "DnD" got a great Kenny Mason feature where he addresses racism in the rock world while still going off. "Sean-Jared" is just a fun song where the duo go flow for flow and the beat progression is just fun to hear. "Closed Caption" is a great breather in the album where the duo reflects on how life can deal a shitty hand with a guitar beat that just build to a chaotic climax in the end. "Panic!!!" is my favorite hype song on this everything is on point. "Full English" is funny asf but I can see how some may view it as annoying, but teezo had another gorgeous feature on it as usual. the last track "we fall" closes the album off amazingly they talk about just being locked in despite getting hated on or missing out on love, the second verse is just phenomenal. I really do love this album go listen 2 it urself fr!</p>

  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	Travis dropped my most anticipated album this year, I was so hyped for it that I even made a blog about ONE album. First of all the rollout was just a blast we had a movie, the briefcases, and the hidden features initially just made me so hyped. When the album dropped I was in my car with 2 homies, shit was bumpin' fr. On first listen i thought rob49 was YB and i started getting soo turnt i shook the whip hahahha. sadly it wasn't YB but Rob49 killed that verse. the album is just filled with so many hype moments "Fein" "meltdown" hyaena" and "Topiatwins" have probably become house party anthems by now. this project combines Travis's darker aesthetics from the rodeo era with the pure hype of the Astroworld era. I really think it's his best album.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>2) Burning Desire - MIKE</h2>

  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	MIKE has been great for a while, but this album deserves to be in a museum. MIKE produces and raps his ass off on this, so many tracks to talk about but I'll keep it brief. "African Sex Fantasy" is one of my favorite beats this year, just so hard and it got that little dog woofing its dope man. "Snake Charm" oh my god its smooth but so sad MIKES lazy delivery works well with it he said, "it means the most when you hit me it show i exist". I had to pause the song when I heard that, because I legit got goosebumps, hope he is doing well real talk. "Set the Mood" is just so smooth MIKES ears for samples is undefeated I swear. "Mussel Beach" is my favorite MIKE verse ever he just eats its up and leaves no crumbs. There is so many other songs I fw off this project but I don't have that type of time to write it all, just listen for yourself and see!</p>

  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	I just really love this album, when I was talking about aesthetics matching music earlier, this is the prime example of that. Ken delivered big time, I genuinely love every song on this album. The crazy thing is I didn't care about it dropping at all, my homeboy told me about it the night it came out, and my apartment power went out so I said fuck it let me drive around. 3 albums dropped that night, Burning Desire, Then You Pray for Me, and AGC. As you can imagine it was a really good car ride... I love this album so much ill go track for track on it.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="blog">"Green Room" - F1lthy production and Ken Carson just talks his shit I love this opener its both about flexing and feeling lonely, it shows he uses materialism to fill the void.</p>
  <p class="blog">"Jennifers Body" - dunn du dun dun        du dun dunnn FUCK this song is fun man, Ken just has a different flow on this its a fun song. that chorus mannn i scream "2 things i never seen" all time now</p>
  <p class="blog">"Fighting my Demons"- he is not playing fair putting this after jenifers body, this song is harder than JB, and that ending is just peak music</p>
  <p class="blog">"Singapore" - Ken n Lone area  great duo but I can't take Lone verse serious he just sooooooooo dumb sometimes if ya know ya know! but ken said "if you tak to me you talking to the money yea im a walking ATM" and this generational truly</p>
  <p class="blog">"Lose it" - here is the most chaotic track on the album, and I think its just phenomenal i love the beat so much</p>
  <p class="blog">"Hardcore" - just a banger, he fully embraces the chaos I wanna fight someone to this song</p>
  <p class="blog">"Me N My Kup" - that part in his verse where he changes the flow is so elite the little melodic section is really catchy too</p>
  <p class="blog">"Its over" - its a good interlude very chaotic too but he shouted out lil baby soooo W</p>
  <p class="blog">"Succubus" - DAMNNN HE FUCKING HATESSS HER FR</p>
  <p class="blog">"Paranoid" - better than Singapore IMO, the beat is just soooo catchy espeically in the end where the synth gets introduced</p>
  <p class="blog">"Pots" - the beat is just really cool, and the melody at the end is fire</p>
  <p class="blog">"Like This" - Uzi had a great verse felt like vintage uzi, they kinda ate it ngl</p>
  <p class="blog">"Overtime" - Ken is ambitious but i really doubt he will become a billionaire </p>
  <p class="blog">"Vampire Hour" - this line alone makes this song a W "I'm a vampire, yeah

    The only time I change is when I turn into a bat
    
    That boy changed, we thought he was real, he turned to a rat"</p>
  <p class="blog">"nightcore 1" - love how the chorus answers the question proposed in the bridge</p>
  <p class="blog">"nightcore 2" - he is such a loverboy in this!</p>
  <p class="blog">"Rockstar Lifestyle" - he kinda sounds like future on this</p>
  <p class="blog">"i need u" - what did you spend ur racks on!? </p>
  <br>
  <p class="blog">i really just love that album hahahhaha </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="blog">	it has been a great year for alt rap tbh, so many interesting releases and I have been truly enjoying it all. what albums did you like this year LMK and I hope y'all have a happy new year! may 2024 give us more life and fun</p>

    <h2>Albums that disappointed me 2k23</h2>


   <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
   <p class="blog">
    2023 was a pretty unusual year for me while I enjoyed many albums from artists I don't usually bump, the artists I do bump just ended up disappointing me. lets not dabble here too long we all know how this goes... </p>

      <h2>1) How do you sleep at night - Teezo Touchdown </h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/6500708300c361fe1f460ef3/1:1/w_3000,h_3000,c_limit/Teezo%20Touchdown-%20How%20Do%20You%20Sleep%20at%20Night" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
     
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="blog">	Now this album isn't bad by any means, its actually average to me, but I feel it is a massive waste of potential. Teezo is an artist that I really started fw this year after seeing him in NYC I became very excited about his debut project. The project dropped in September when I was (surprise surprise) going to NY again so it was a nice full-circle moment for me. The first listen of this project is definitely the best if you are just down for the ride, teezo tackles so many different genres and it is just a blast on first listen, but the flaws started to glare when I realized that, not many of these songs are really songs. a lot of them feel more like ideas especially in the latter half with "Nu Nay" and "I Don't think u c me" even the longer songs are really just combined mini songs, for example, the best and worst track on the album is "Too Easy" on my first listen of the project I kept skipping the song cuz it just gave me a fucking headache, but one day I forgot to skip and a minute 40 later the song completely changed to teezos BEST vocal performance ever. The way tiktok was gassing up his feature on for all the dogs is how they should have gassed this verse cuz it just makes me cry sometimes. I think this is teezos biggest problem, he prioritizes being weird over being good, he can sing like a MF when he wants to and I like weird music like the rest of yall, but when you sacrifice quality just to be different it just leaves me thinking "what if?" </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>2) For all the dogs - drake</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/05/Drake_-_For_All_The_Dogs.png" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
    <p class="blog">	Now this album is just embarrassing, I loved this when it first dropped but like room-temperature milk, it went bad fast. This is bar none Drake's worst project in my opinion. Drake is pushing 40 and getting mad that his 25 year old ex doesn't like him even though he has more money than her new man... it's just kinda sad to see after all these years, drake lost what made him... him. It can be argued that drake was always a womanizing misogynist, and I am not here to play a lawyer but it is undeniable that drake also used to at least be more self-aware. A great example is on the song "Too Good" if it was just drake I would walk away thinking wow he is kinda  douche, but the song is saved from a riri ft showing that drake is aware that maybe he isn't all that. that nuance is lost in his latest project. "her loss" had this same problem too but at least that album is fun and grew on me while for all the dogs makes me more and more sad to be a drake fan. P.S don't get me started on that deluxe soooooo ass! for all the dogs is the first Drake album that I can't play anywhere. Drake has always been a soundtrack artist for me, his albums have always fit a specific thing for me weather it be a season, place or person for example, Honestly nevermind is my go 2 plane album, More Life for the islands, Views in the winter and Take care on a sentimental night. This album doesn't have that effect for me which makes me truly sad especially since he postponed his concert for this stupid album. I will forever be mad about that!</p>

    <h2>3) Cracker Island - Gorillaz</h2>

    margin: 0 auto;">
    <p class="blog">	Just meh, i mean its a solid synth-pop album. i really can't even speak on it too much. the bad bunny song is great though.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>4) Kaytramine - Kaytramine</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b7/Kaytramin%C3%A9_-_Kaytramin%C3%A9.png" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	When this dropped i was ridin it harddd man (pause), but that high only lasted a week. I think the project was a huge fumble by both Amine and Kaytranda. A lot of these beats are just kinda whatever, and Amine should have gone with a more melodic direction like he did on TWOPOINTFIVE. I mean I liked some songs though, forever, sossup, and STFU3 are dope asf, but this album had SUMMER ANTHEM written all over it but just ended up being a passing breeze.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>5) Voir Dire - Earl</h2>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRVtKxB5_4xVxy4mozRcvDqWPR-6CtGP6RjiQ&s" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	We need to have a conversation about the alchemist man. His beats are boring, its the same trick he's been doing for years now (insert meme of the game using the same bar) and I am sick of it. He slows down any rapper he works with, after earls project sick I was excited to see what he would cook up next, especially after a great single plus an immaculate homage to MF DOOM from Atlanta season 4 I had a lot of reasons to be hyped for earl. the album itself is fine though, earls raps are as good as they always are, but these beats man just bore me. the track "Mancala" is my favorite because I love Vince Staples and the beat actually has some energy which is dope. "27 briads" is dope too love that guitar</p>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="blog">	I hate that these albums didn't stick for me, I do fw these artists. the good news is that they don't have to impress me. All of these artists have already made a piece of work that I still love and admire to this day (except teezo but im still rootin for him). What they did this year doesn't change the music they made in the past so I encourage them to explore new sounds rather than try to recapture lighting, it just didn't stick for me personally. If you like these projects then more power to you, I don't even hate these albums outside of the drake one personally. Next blog my official top 10 album list!</p>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">	6 million monthly listeners is far from underground I know... but I still want to spread the agenda, this album is absolutely fun. The production has a mix of Asian and island influences and her vocal inflections range from hype to sexual. the project feels grandiose the beat on "Wasted Eyes" is one of my favorite things, with its punchy drums and magnificent horns it just feels like a true achievement in music. This year has been rather boring for pop music to me, but I found this release to be refreshing like running through a water fountain.</p>

    <h2>2) The 4th Wall - bbygoyard</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-kxuZydFj9QP7No3Z-dHDyEA-t500x500.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Bbygoyard had a busy year this year with 3 whole projects, I think Loreseeker is his best project personally, but 4thwall is an impressive collection of songs. "The 4thwall" is a double album of 4thwall pt1 and 2, part 2 is 10 fold better than part 1, but I wanted to talk about the full package because I feel part 1 needs some recognition despite it lacking the now iconic DJ Smokey taglines that we tend to associate bbygoyard with. The song "New Graphics" is my favorite on side A and has the least amount of streams on the whole album. THIS IS NOT RIGHT, go listen to that song the beat is insane actually and the chorus is catchier than the flu. As for part 2 it has some songs that go crazy as well, "Teacups and kettles", "Slashed Tires" and the now infamous "Vette Sum" go crazy in the car and are just a blast to play. the album is a ton of fun and I recommend it.</p>

    <p class="blog">	This guy is the definition of aura, I saw his name and album cover and immediately saw his vision. He is a pretty new artist but he has a great ear for beats and can create a dark mood really well. The project has so many great beats the obvious highlight is the clams casino produced track "kiss n tell" which has this gorgeous vocal sample flip and the chop work at the end just elevates the track to a level reminiscent of old A$AP Rocky. Other tracks are really solid too "Dallas Interlude" is just a vibe in the simplest way possible, the song legit leaves me in a trance. "Roundtripz" and "In the Spur" both are really hard songs the latter has a really dope beat that has these keys that just string the beat together nicely. The last highlight I'd like to share is "Cuban Linx" the Bon Iver sample was very unexpected but the subject matter of the song was actually touching and I was shocked he got so vulnerable on the album. Overall the album is kinda rough in terms of flow but he got hella promise I like him.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">	This is a really solid IDM album, but also a great example of what good mixing can do to elevate a project. I am just in love with the textures of this album, I fell in love with it on a plane ride back in the fall, and has since then been in my rotation for nights where I wear my good headphones. I am a huge fan of the tracks with vocals, I can tell he was going in a more haunting direction, as the vocals on this album strike me more like drones or sirens out in the sea that just captivate me to a rhythm. the title track has to be the highlight for me I am a huge fan of the track build-up because the final 2 minutes of it are just a euphoric rush. to best enjoy a release like this I highly recommend either relaxing, reading, meditating, or studying while listening.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Joony is a DMV artist hailing from Maryland the land of good seafood and bad drivers. I find this project to be a blast something about darker atmospheric albums just clicked for me this year I can't lie. the track "OOOOOO" has a really dope beat the melody is murky and the phone ringing in the mix plays a good contrast to keep the tone more energetic. "Keisha" and "Shitumss" both are really hard and have that classic DMV sound. To me, it felt like a throwback to me. The track "Hold Me Down" is also pretty dope Joony taps into his melodic side, it is kinda reminiscent of Nav but I like it. Overall its a solid project I fw Joony.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Sideshow is a perfect mix of being hard and abstract. His production style is just a treat for the ears with a fun mix of soul samples and trap drums. I saw him live and his energy is just elite. If you like MIKE then you would love sideshow. Songs like "JIH LIKE MORANT" is only a minute long but will show you what he is all about give it a try and tap in!</p>

    margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Shout out to Ellie Goulding for keeping that 2010's pop alive! While most of her contemporaries of her era ventured off into different sounds, Lady Gaga making albums with Tony Bennet, Miley Cyrus making ballads, and Britaney doing spins in her mansion, Ellie chose to stay the same and improve the formula. This album takes all the aspects I love about 2010's pop and just improves upon them. the beats are so fun and danceable, it's a shame Pop went to a more slow and drab scene. I miss music I could dance to and she got it! "like a savior" "By the end of the night" and "Let it die" have great beats and her vocal range is actually really impressive, she is an amazing singer.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	This year was hard for me to recommend albums without talking about my top 10, in all honesty, a lot of albums disappointed me this year, but that is a blog for another day. I still highly recommend these albums and at one point they were in my official top 10 list so i can assure their quality!</p>

  "Twelve grams of protein is nice... I often crush up my Oreos and put them in there to add some flavor when I'm feeling devilish, ya ever had that Danny?" "huh -wha did I miss something" Danny abruptly muttered. "You did it again didn't you, I knew this was going to be hard for the both of us but lately it feels like you're not even here anymore," she said as her eyes shifted to the couch that used to seat her husband. "I understand why you did it ya know, I too wish I could turn my brain off and forget the world, but baby you have people who care about you, people who you spent years building relationships with are you really going to throw all that away just because you're in a mood". Danny would groan but say no more, for what he lacked in language he made up for in tone. "I see, I'll give you your space tonight, but we need to make a decision soon we can still fix it ya know," she spoke as she walked to the bedroom. The night would end like all nights do for Danny, with shitty cable TV and cheap liquor. This is a cycle that has been consuming him for 3 months now since the surgery. As for the money, he no longer needed to worry about it, as long as nothing changed in his life he would be more than well off.

    <p class="blog">	The year is 2297, the world is run by robots powered by AI and the effects of the AI are not nearly as bad as the ancestors would have thought. I mean sure there was record-high unemployment for nearly 250 years, but in the last 47 years we turned it into a lazy man's paradise. The economy is based around the haves and the have-nots. Those who have a job and those who "have not" a brain. The government realized the human brain is the ultimate supercomputer and it is being wasted on lesser lifeforms when it could be used to power an AI robot 100x more efficiently. So they launched a program where you could lease your brain and get a monthly royalty check. As long as your brain is in a machine then you will get a portion of its earnings. A month of the work a robot can do covers a lifetime of work for the average man. As of late the operation has become rather trendy, if you can get more money doing less then a man without a brain is smarter than one with one... Would ya say so?</p>

<p class="blog">	4:37 PM, Danny was awakened from the fortress of his couch by the sound of silence. He veered to the corner of the room to see his wife, Francesca eyeing him with the remote in hand. "I was watching that you knowwww" he uttered his first  sentence in what felt like years. She took a deep sigh, "do you know what day it is today?" she muttered in a shakey tone. His eyes began to glow like a dusty projector being used after years of collecting dust. What felt like a wave of hope began to fill her soul as he thought. For a second the anticipation felt as sweet as the euphoria of winning, but you can never count your eggs too early as he would ultimately mutter "Dr.Who Marathon". The heights she felt would ultimately be the heights she fell from as the hope that once filled her soul turned to resentment. She had realized the man she knew was far gone. She would leave that day after writing a note on the side of the bed he had yet to sleep in. </p>

<p class="blog">	The life of the Salmon is the life of wisdom. The salmon sees the wonders of the ocean and fears it. They enjoy its treasures and beauty but realize its dangers are far more severe for their young. they make the sacrifice to go back to where they come from to ensure the safety of their offspring. The journey is filled with many obstacles from humans, and bears but the most fierce of all is the flow of water. Water like time only moves one way, the fish can't change that fact but chooses to push forward anyway with the resilience and determination to secure the next generation. Their legacy lives with their struggle and their sacrifice is reciprocated for generations. Salmon are just one in five species to swim upstream. One must wonder who taught them that and what the salmon see in the ocean to realize they need to come back despite their other brethren settling in the salt. To go upstream isn't to go backwards, the treasures of this world can control you as much as they allure you.</p>

<p class="blog">Francesca headed out the door and caught a self-driving cab to a motel. she would light a cigarette by the nightstand and scroll her phone but just saw contacts of people she once called. Tears started to roll down her face like waterfalls, and thoughts of conforming began to fill her mind. What’s the point of swimming upstream if everything I do is unseen? What is the point of being different if nobody cares? Why did I choose this life if it would end up in isolation? She dug into her purse and found an old business card, she started shaking at the realization of what she thought crawled through her spine. “it’s time, one can’t be free if everyone else is in prison.” she nodded and reached for the phone.</p>

<br>
<p class="blog">Years passed and like sand in the wind, it all changed. society ultimately collapsed and the world became a jungle of rust and debris. The AI robots eventually saw no need for humans which caused another unemployment high of 100%, which ended in a total bankruptcy of the government, causing the brainless to go broke along with the unemployed. those with a brain tried to revolt but it ultimately led to total annihilation, as within a day we saw nuclear warfare. Nobody survived. The world is a desert of radiation and regret. centuries down the line a truly greater life form would explore a very familiar apartment as they read a burnt note that read “Happy birthday…” The rest of the note was lost due to the war, but the proof of intelligence still stood. in the end, you did exist.</p>

 <p class="blog">	"Well, Mr. Ghostface I'm glad ya asked, scary movies have been a bit of an infatuation for me as of late and this October was filled with a few watches of some old classics as well as some fresh blood in the world of horror. If you don't mind I would like to talk about the medium as a whole I hope it's not too late for a Halloween special. My love for the genre is actually rather newfound, I actually used to really hate horror movies, and for a good reason too. That reason is that I was a literal CHILD and I was scared. As a kid, I would only watch comedies, but whenever I would get a glimpse of the taboo known as horror I would always be filled with regret. Just like the cat, I too was killed by my own curiosity every so often I would find myself peaking clips or watching scenes on YouTube or behind the couch as my dad would idly watch some C-list horror movie edited down to fit a cable airing. Things like "Final Destination" and "The Ring" really scared me as a child, and I know this isn't technically a horror movie, but "The Good Son" also scared me so bad as a kid that I would end up praying like 8 times in a row that my mom would not throw me off a cliff. (*writer note, my mom is a good person and wouldn't throw me off a cliff), but it was the ideas that these films presented to my young mind that generated such fear. the idea that anything can go wrong at any given moment, or that your own family will let you go are real fears that people have and these films portray them, well I would say they portray them well, but on rewatch I have come to a conclusion that most of these films don't portray them good at all. What scared me as a child just bores me as an adult, (The Good Son is still a good movie, but it's not scary anymore), I have come to realize that when it comes to horror films I was born in the wrong generation.

    <p class="blog">	Now I know that is an oldhead ass saying, but if you walk with me right quick I will run you down the highs and lows of this beautiful and twisted genre known as horror. From its origins to its new modern incarnation, I would like to highlight a few films and features of each era today.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Starting off with the birth of horror, the early 1900s focused on religious imagery to garner fear, but I personally doubt fear was what they were trying to achieve with these films. Films like "The Infernal Cauldron" and "The Devil's Castle" utilized slight of hand and primitive camera techniques to create illusions and surprise audiences. While these films are impressive for their time, a modern audience would not even budge let alone move at the peaks of these horrors. What they lacked in fear they more than made up for in creativity and ambition these films were the pioneers of the genre we love today.</p>
    <br>

  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
   <p class="blog">(Image: The Devils Castle 1896)</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Our next iteration of horror will come from an old literature influence. The rise of the classic monster pictures such as Frankenstein and Dracula, is thanks to movies evolving to being longer and having audio. This was huge for the genre of horror because sound design can really make or break the atmosphere of a film for me. Dracula 1931 still is impressive to me, I find the portrayal of the iconic vampire to still be the blueprint today with the way he dressed, the way his mansion was designed, and of course his iconic accent. I was just a big fan of this era, but these films did not scare me not even an inch. This is more so just a testament to how iconic these characters have become though, I mean it is hard to be scared of characters that appear on seasonal cereal boxes or characters that were played by Adam Sandler. The horror impact these films have may have lost its grip due to society no longer fearing these monsters, but the films of that era are still a treat in my opinion.</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	The 50's and 60's led to a rise in alien and zombie films, perhaps due to a post-nuclear world, we channeled our fears into the extra terrestrial or the idea of a zombie apocalypse. I'm not sure I don't really care for zombies, but in Japan, they dropped Godzilla which was definitely fueled by the ghosts of the war. what is now a sensationalized mascot for Japan was once an eerie tale of the reproductions of nuclear war. Nuclear war is still very real and has been used as a plot device many times before, but in terms of fear, it is rather low for me... so on to the next era, please.
</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	This is where we finally arrive at the classic era of horror that we know today. The rise of the slasher thanks to the original "Halloween" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". These films birthed a new era of staples and tropes that we would see in horror movies for the next century. the appeal of these slasher films was that they weren't *too* supernatural, it felt like you could be a victim to the killer, and this created real fear. but the fear was only a byproduct of the real appeal of slashers and that is the thrill, slashers made murdering people exciting. It may be a taboo, but deep down everybody wanted to see how many fucked up ways somebody could get killed. Another appeal of these films is the new rise in sex appeal, I find the trope to be beyond tired now but people like a good set of tits when it comes to their slasher movies. Outside of slashers we also got a taste of other classics like Alien and Jaws which appeal to our more primal fear. a fear of the wild, it's our nature to want to feel superior to other species so seeing a killer alien or unstoppable great white shark, made many audiences feel rather unsafe and eerie. While I like Jaws and think it's a good movie, I have to condemn it for the negative reproductions it created on not just cinema but the environment as a whole. It's absurd to me that fear created from a movie can create such a cruel and uneducated movement such as endangering a whole species.</p>

<br>
<p class="blog">	Movies would only get gorier and gorier as the years went on, Jason and Freddy dominated the 80's with their classic franchises, but we also had some other classics such as "The Shining", "The Poltergeist" and "The Thing". I have yet to see those 3 though, I only wrote them down so I can remind myself to get around to them. Horror was alive and booming in the 80's there were just so many options to choose from and it would only continue as we went into the 90's. the 90's burst the gates when it came to the diversity of films. Films like "Silence of the lambs" "Scream" and "Candyman" are phenomenal and push the genre even further than before.</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	Silence of the Lambs is a cinematic masterpiece filled with suspense, body horror, and twists. it is not only a great horror movie but it is a great movie in general. The horror comes from the fear of the genius and madness of Doctor Hanibal Lecter. Despite him being arguably one of the weaker characters in terms of raw power, I find the sight of him to make me feel so uneasy. Very rarely do you see a character so human seem so monstrous, but he pulls it off perfectly. If you have yet to see this film go give it a watch, the first watch of this movie is one of the best cinematic experiences I have ever had.</p>

margin: 0 auto;">
<br>
<p class="blog">	Scream is another great film that seeks to parody the (at this point) overdone slasher genre. It does it really well while also ironically enough being a really good slasher. I think the movie is funny and I am a fan of the franchise, scream 6 was really good this year. The climate of the 90's was hot in media due to a rise in censorship, thanks to increasingly violent media. Mortal Kombat had it's blood removed on Nintendo consoles, Beavis couldn't make fires anymore and parents were just looking for ANY REASON other than themselves as to why their kids are acting like assholes. Scream made fun of the notion that violent media creates real-world violence by making a killer inspired by violent movies. it is ridiculous on purpose it challenges the audience to sit and think, "is it reasonable to assume these movies will make me a killer?" the question being rhetorical of course.</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	Candyman is just a sweet movie man (get it cuz candy is sweet). I would write more but I got a schedule to keep soooo on to the fall of horror...</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	The 2000's sucked ass for horror movies IMO films like final destination and paranormal activity just bore me or annoy the fuck out of me. Paranormal Activity specifically created a horrible trend in film due to their marketing campaign, the now infamous "theatre reaction" trailer set a new goal for movie studios and it wasn't to make good films. they now aimed to make the biggest reactions. Horror films became over-glorified amusement park rides filled with cheap scares and too-realistic gore. The "Saw" franchise started in the 2000's and I actually think the movies are solid, but they are rather uncomfortable for even me at times I can't lie.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p class="blog">	Today though I am very optimistic about horror movies in the future. in the mid to late 2010's we saw a more arthouse take on the genre with studio A24 dropping some solid films such as "Pearl" "Hereditary" and "Midsommar" we also got Jordan Peele dropping some phenomenal films like "Nope" "Get Out" and "Us". These films gave horror the respect it deserved in a post-paranormal activity world and I am looking forward to what comes next.</p>

 <p class="blog">	Hello everyone, I am currently writing this during the first day of my senior year of college. I am currently in between classes, and I have been struck by both inspiration and nostalgia for the summer that has just ensued upon me. Now if you recall at the beginning of summer, I made a blog post about why I am excited about the summer and what I want to do. heading into the summer I was mostly excited about, Bonnaroo, California, and just spending time at home doing normal things like museums and concerts. I am happy to report that I did and enjoyed all of that and then some more!

    <p class="blog">Let's start in chronological order, the first thing I did was watch Paprika and shin kamen rider within the same week. These two films were really good Paprika specifically and I am so glad I finally got around to watching it. the group of friends I saw it with are dope and I found myself spending a lot of time with them this summer. Paprika was a generational movie, it is like an anime version of Inception but the overall themes and message are very endearing and I shed a tear watching it. Shin Kamen Rider was a dope action film and I am a fan of the shin series, having been recently put on to it thanks to Shin Ultraman, if you are a fan of that classic era of Japanese cinema then these shin movies will satisfy you for sure. they are both cheesy and badass at the same time.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">	The next thing I did was go to new york for the Tisakorean show. This trip impacted me way more than I expected, I came back home a fan of both the city of new york and Tisakorean. I already made a blog about tisa before so I will talk about the other aspects of that trip that changed me. My friends and I met Teezotouchdown at the park and he played some unreleased music. That encounter with Teezo, definitely made me become a bigger fan of him. He just looks so cool and I felt he had a nice soul. He is quiet in person I think he is shy. Another thing that was lit in New York was the food, we ate good every day there. There is a fire ass bakery in the train station that genuinely made me think about dropping my diet. I had a key lime pie that was to die for, but my boy said the banana pudding is divine. The library in NYC is a great hangout spot as well I would real life just chill there and read because I was so tired after that early morning train ride. Overall NYC opened me up to the power of short trips, I will be visiting new york a lot, I love it there and it can easily work with my schedule as just a weekend thing. The New York trip reminded me that I wasn't trapped.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">	After NYC, my next major move would be a month later @ Bonaroo. Bonaroo is basically a hippie Coachella, ngl I was nervous about it. Camping, Hydrating, and all the people seemed kinda stressful to me, but once my homeboy and I set up camp, I felt a sense of joy. before there were shows I was just enjoying the atmosphere of Bonaroo so much, we would literally just go running around and finding new people based on how cool their tents were. Thanks to that strategy we were able to meet new friends and have a group to roll with when we hit shows, which can be very helpful in dealing with big crowds of people. Everything at the festival was amazing, but the main reason I was there was definitely for the artists, and sheesh they did not disappoint. I was able to see, foo fighters, korn, 070 Shake, Baby Keem, Kendrick Lamar, Lil Nas x, Paramore, and so many other great artists. the hardest part about Roo for me was leaving (literally the traffic was insane and it was raining like hell). Overall Roo reminded me that I am young and I love having fun, I genuinely was starting to feel like an old head but that roo energy hit me hard.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Now literally a day after I got back home from Bonnaro. I had my next move, it was a performance for my friend Sam's album release party. I still had my voice partially gone but the energy and musical itch I had post roo gave me plenty of motivation to thug it out. the performance is on youtube, and Sam's album is on streaming everywhere please be sure to support Sam for I am honored that he put me on his show.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">I was so tired after all that music though, I decided to lay low for a bit, just work and relax more. I went to Vegas and New York again in July for a BJJ tournament and a small music festival. I was so tired though but I still really enjoyed them. new york part 2 was funny because we went to the club after the music festival, and I ordered Monfungo and ate it right next to the dance floor. At the end of July, I would go to California for my family. I love going to California because I feel loved over there, it has always felt like a home to me, and coming back as an adult is even more interesting. it's a confusing dichotomy because my grandparents still treat me like a baby while my aunts and uncle treat me like a grown ass man. I love it though, I still let my grandma feed me if she wants to fr. My uncle got like 4 kids who are like baby-age. They are really sweet and I loved seeing them and trying to keep them entertained. Overall Cali was a great contrast to the high-action things I had been doing. I was able to take a step back and be with my family which was needed.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">To end my summer I saw Beyonce live at FedEx field. As a performer, Beyonce is without a doubt one of the greatest to ever do it. I was flabbergasted at her vocal ability and even though I was at the top row in the rain I felt a true bliss just being able to see and hear what can be argued as musical perfection. On the last day of summer, I went to the fair to officially close the book on my summer vacation. it was a little corny, but in a cute way I rode the Ferris wheel as the fair closed, it was symbolic of me looking at my summer ending from the height  I was standing at. From that height I can say I 100% enjoyed the view, my summer has been everything I hoped and then some. In addition to what I mentioned earlier I have also been doing BJJ, and just reading as well. This summer made me enjoy so much in my life and I am currently in a really happy headspace. Thank you to my people who made this summer memorable for me. this really was my best summer ever. </p>

  <h2>Utopia: first impressions</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">	Well the day has finally come, Travis Scott has finally dropped Utopia and with the wait came huge expectations from not only me but the rap fanbase as a whole, did he deliver? In my opinion, HE 100% DID and right now I would like to share a few moments and things that really stood out to me. This isn't a review or a deep dive, I just want to share my initial thoughts.
</p>

<div class="container"
    style="display:none;">
<!--Insert the rest of your blog's text here!-->
    <p class="blog">	In the very beginning of the album being announced I was not excited at all, I was convinced Travis Scott grew off me. I always associated his music with my cringe ass high school years. Travis did something I didn't expect though, as we got closer to the album dropping he actually made me get hyped, this is one of the best album rollouts since the Kanye donda 1 era. So when that album dropped best believe I was hyped as hell. I got in my car with some homies and loitered in a backroad and let the music run its course.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	As for the music itself, I was genuinely blown away by the production and variation. The album takes a more mellow and ambient approach to production for some songs and I feel these tracks play for a great contrast to the more hype rager songs I associate travis with. The first song sets the pace so fucking well, its exciting but dark, it evokes both excitement and curiosity. Modern Jam has a feature from the GOAT teezo touchdown and is produced by 1/2 of daft punk, i just think that's neat the song is easily a highlight for me. My Eyes is another track I really enjoyed, I thought frank ocean was on it for a second when I first spun it, The first half being this cold, slow and ambient like beat serves as a great breather for the beautiful transition into a more hyped up second half. Drake was on the album that song "meltdown" was really good too. Fein was a good song, a younger me would have loved it more, im kind of over carti, but pairing him up with sheck wes and carti doing a new cadence was a great move and made the song hype. That Beyoncé track sounds like a renaissance B-side, which I was all here for. I Know? is probably the catchiest song on my first listen and is one of my favs. I thought YB was on topia twins but it was just Rob49.... :( still a good song. Parasail a great breather track because the next track skitzo is just 6 minutes of hype, we had a good young thug feature and a nice beat switch. Lost forever is really really good one of the first utopia era songs to be shared around, but the album release version has a new beat during westside gunn's part which elevates the song to an upper echelon. looove is good love the dance beat but could do without the cudi verse, i hate when he does that cadence where he sounds like a bored cicada. K-Pop is a good song but it definitly feels out of place, bad bunny is still the goat though and ate it up. Telekenisis is INSANEEE future cant do any wrong and SZA at the end put this in my top 3 fosho. the last song was a good outro James Blake is a safe beat for a feature and the 21 verse was solid.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">My overall thoughts on the album, I think its really fun and has potential to be my favorite Travis album, it embraces the darker sounds like rodeo but has the stacked hyped moments like astroworld. Sometimes though I feel travis gets outshined on some of the songs, even on a production standpoint while I liked the beats, I can definitely say they felt like they were made for the featured artists in mind more than travis. Even on some of the solo travis songs like gods country and thank god, it sounds more like a kanye song (well some of the songs are actually old kanye scraps so that makes sense). Travis is good though and does show his versatility on this album really well, I think it will take me more listens to point him out better. </p>

  <h2>Tisakorean an Ode to Silliness</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">Tisakorean is an artist that I was put on to rather recently. Back in May, I went to New York for his concert because my friends invited me. Before the concert, I only knew a few of his songs and thought nothing of him. I viewed the concert as an opportunity to travel and get drunk with some friends so naturally I accepted. The concert though was more than I could have imagined it opened with a great set by Dazegxd which was elite off-rip, then when Tisa came on stage I felt a new energy take me. Usually at concerts im either lit, sad, raging, or dancing. At Tisa though I was just #SILLY :P everyone at the venue was wearing a silly outfit tisa included, he even wore a hot dog costume mid-show and his hype man had an ice spice munch shirt on as well.

  <p class="blog">That munch shirt sooo fye doe!!</p>
   
    <br>
    <br>
  
    <p class="blog">	Anyways back to the story, the vibes were just silly every song he performed really felt like a joke. not a bad joke, a really good joke I had a lot of fun I was enjoying the music on an ironic "soulja boy swag" level of understanding. I think that's where most people see Tisa. Towards the end of his set though he performed one song that really changed my mind on him as an artist...</p>
    <br>
    <img src="/images/backseatplays.png" style="width: 90%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	This fucking song bruh.... Backseat in my opinion is Tisa's magnum opus. it's not just his best song... it is THE BEST SONG EVER. I knew this was a song from don toliver album earlier (spoiler alert go down is my favorite song off Don's album too). Hearing Backseat Live changed me though. This song is both silly and romantic, I feel warm listening to this song. The production and vocal effects are alien even for the average tisa song. Even Tisa knows how special this song is and during the show he had the whole crowd wave their hands around and sing along. This song from that moment had a hold on me and made me realize that tisakorean is more than just a silly dude, he is in fact one of the best artists of our generation.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Speaking of silly dude, I'd like to talk about the next song Sillydude. This song right here is special man, Tisa once again makes a more low-key song. this one is melancholic despite the silly name. This song is about Tisa talking to this girl who says she acts silly, tisa responds by saying that he is silly too, and that he is a silly dude. Now the actual dialogue is simple and not what I'm analyzing. the part I find interesting is the meaning of silly in this song. Silly is said in a more demeaning way, especially when you compare it to his iconic (SILLY!) adlib. I feel this song was about how people look down on silly people, that they discount them and can't take them seriously because they are simply too silly. In the last verse, Tisa said he needs a silly hoe to teach him everything she knows. To Tisa being silly isn't being stupid, being silly is simply a way of life.</p>
<br>
<p class="blog"><i><b>Part II. Embrace the silly :3</b></i></p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	SILLY SILLY SILLY SILLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you gotta be a silly hoe. the philosophy of tisakorean and his music is that it is fun > perfect. his albums and songs are all about moments you can't just play his album front 2 back in ur bedroom alone you need to be in a silly mood to have fun. the two songs I mentioned earlier are probably his few exceptions to my rule because I can spin those songs alone all the time (believe me I DID HAHAHA). We enjoy music the same way we enjoy the beach on a summer day. There are albums that are critically acclaimed and viewed as a perfect piece of work, this is akin to people metal detecting for gold by the shore. Sure there is a lot of work in understanding some of these harder albums but the payoff is well worth it. Artists like Drake are the beach volleyball of music, it's fun and accessible and everyone can get into it. Lastly, we have Tisa's music he makes the music for the silly hoes who play around in the water or build sand boobs on top of their homies. It's childish, it's silly but it's both oddly nostalgic and really fun. Once in a while enjoy the water, my friends, it's a hot summer after all :P</p>

  <h2>Summer 2k23 (the finale)</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">Despite the shitty weather and my new office job, I can't help but feel the overwhelming joys of summer vacation upon myself right now. I came into this summer with the mindset that it is my last real summer since I am graduating next spring I will no longer be on the same time as a student. Personally, I am really excited about that, because despite my current joy right now, I actually hate summer it is easily my least favorite season and I yearn for the days when I can just work and take my days off in the middle of October instead of a hot and busy 3-month timespan of being around loud, sweaty and smelly people. These flights are too damn expensive and these tourists just kill my vibe personally, even my own city aint safe considering I live next to the nation's capital and all that. Despite me hating this time of year though, I do have a specific fondness for this specific summer. Something about it being my "last summer" is just dramatic enough for me to give a fuck I guess.

    <p class="blog">	So how will I make my summer hit different? Right now am trying to maximize spending more time with the people around me and doing more local activities that I love in the DMV. Things like museums, libraries, concerts, and sports are all things I really would love to do this summer, hell I would even enjoy just chilling with a homie and watching TV. I really don't have the dreams of grandeur that I once had as of right now I only got 1 vacation planned and that is Bonaroo, and personally I am okay with that (but mom i know u read my blogs, I AM LYING ON THIS SENTANCE pleaseeee i wanna go to cali again cuz i miss the fam). okay soooo I really want 2 vacations, but a family trip doesn't count sooo IDC go debate a wall. Back to the main point, for the summer I am really just contempt with chilling and doing the same activities that drove me mad in summer's past.  maybe I am changing as a person but a lot of things don't excite me like they used to anymore and with everything I lost interest in I gained an appreciation for new things. Just this week I learned that I really love helping kids, I signed up to do some volunteer work this summer because it seems like something I would genuinely enjoy. Another thing I am finding interest in is museums. I am so blessed to live in the DMV area due to the treasure trove of information that lies behind each of our grand Smithsonian, but really I just like to go there and joke around it's not like I'm a nerd of something hahahahha. Another thing I love now is Brazillian Juijitsu, one of my co-workers invited me to train in his gym and I am having such a ball with it so far. it is a great martial art due to the combination of thinking and physical skill it is a true workout for the mind and body and I am absolutely IN LOVE with it.

  <h2>Unusual Nostalgia</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">
  Nostalgia is the momentum that makes the pendulum of life swing from the past to the present. The fact that we are able mentally transfer ourselves into our own past, to experience some of the sweeter things in life is a feeling that has always been both endearing and tragic to me. In today's society, I feel that we tend to manufacture false nostalgia, which can lead to an unhealthy cycle of reminiscing on the past whilst being bitter about the future. This mindset has turned some of the most optimistic and ambitious people I know into shells of themselves with their only wish to go back in time.

    <p class="blog">Manufactured nostalgia is one thing that has started to irk me more as I’ve grown older. As an #official twenty-something-year-old, I can tell you that there is an increase in “2000’s babies” nostalgia on the internet and in my day-to-day conversations. From my Twitter timeline being full of Spongebob clips, to people trying to gas up those terrible Debby cakes we used to eat as kids. It has gotten sooooo bad these days that even things like the school light fixtures can make people nostalgic. In my opinion, though these things are nothing more than shallow memories that don’t really have much nostalgia because it was just things that were forced upon you. Everyone knows these things and grew up with them, so what makes them special to you? For something to be truly nostalgic, you need a strong emotional connection not just a shallow “Oh yea I remember this as a kid” answer. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Today I want to talk about unusual nostalgia, and why it's different than the oversaturated Twitter bait nostalgia we see in our day-to-day lives. First of all, what is unusual nostalgia? Well since it is a term I made up, I figure I am the most qualified to tell yall, it is a specific thing from your past that only you (or a small population) feel nostalgic for. Seems pretty simple right? But in my opinion, it is its exclusivity that makes it infinitely more meaningful.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	As humans we are designed to find comfort in conformity, we want to feel we fit in with the people around us. This is why so many people find comfort and nostalgia in even the most mundane things of the past. The only true connection they have to it is that everyone else shares that connection. While I do value a shared experience in life, I find this form of nostalgia to ultimately be damaging because it can tend to alienate your present self from society. It is a mindset that allows you to adopt a “life was better back than” mindset. Picture this when we are in our 70s and retired are we going to talk about our office cubicles like how we talk about our high school desks? The answer should hopefully be no, because that would be really sad if we was nostalgic over that. I think school and childhood nostalgia is really easy to make for most people because, for a lot of people, it was a time when they felt the most social due to them not having to try as hard to make friends back then. This type of nostalgia is the junk food of memories it lacks effort and only fulfills you through the most artificial means possible.</p>
    <br>

  margin: 0 auto;">
   
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	For me, the type of nostalgia I value is far more unusual. The nostalgia doesn’t only take me back to my past but also helps build me up to be the man I am today. The personal experiences I hold dear that have changed me are what make up most of my nostalgia. I don’t hold high school in high regard, but I am forever grateful and nostalgic for the football team, and some of my teachers specifically my Spanish teacher Mr.Gale and my government teacher Mr.Busch. These people have given me memories and opportunities to grow and while I don’t look back at my time in high school as something I want to experience again, I find comfort in the fact that I can take a pleasant look at my past and come out with a brighter outlook on my future.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	To get into even more obscure and weird nostalgia though, I will have to go even further back in my life to my childhood. This in my opinion is where I find my true nostalgia. There are three things that make me feel the most nostalgic, the PlayStation 2 startup sound, yellow bricks, and two albums, the first album being “the colour and the Shape” by the foo fighters and the other being a George Michael compilation album. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">The PS2 was a staple in my family quite literally we would spend nights playing Madden or mortal kombat. I was just a little kid so I sucked at both games but I would always remember hearing that sharp start-up sound. It was a sound that was both frightening and enticing, as a child a lot of things seem more scary than what they actually are and nothing encapsulated my childhood fear like that sound. The irony with the fear is that it was all irrational, behind that seemingly traumatizing sound lay some of my favorite gaming memories ever. That sound and that experience shaped me in my future, I don’t really get scared rather I get excited more often. A lot of things that can scare you, can also be challenges and opportunities to do new things. That is one of the main reasons why I’m not a nervous or shy person when it comes to new experiences. </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">Yellow bricks are weird, but growing up both my parents would work so I would spend a lot of my early years at my grandma's house. She lived in this small little yellow brick house in a culdesac. Her house was like something I have never seen before it kinda reminded me of something you would build out of Legos. In a time when I didn’t know addresses or even how to read I found it importance of those yellow bricks to be paramount in my knowing where I was at. The idea that she lived in a place that felt like a landmark to me made me feel safe, even when I was away from my mom and dad. I was a clingy baby (big-time mama’s boy) so me being away woulda scared me, but something about my grandma and her yellow brick home always felt comforting to me. My grandma was dope and we would spend our time together watching cartoons, laughing, and eating. She would spoil the fuck out of me, I can’t even lie, I knew she was real when she would watch Ed Edd n Eddy with me, because my parents used to think a lot of my favorite shows were gross and weird so sharing that with her felt really nice. Every time I see yellow bricks I think of my grandma and I feel comforted, no matter where I go I can always find a home within my heart.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Lastly are the two albums, now if you are an avid or even casual reader of my blogs, then you should know by now that I really love music, but alas that was not always the case. Growing up I was indifferent to music the only things I heard were whatever was on the radio, my mom's Arabic music, and my dad's music. Now both my parents have implanted their music taste in me over time but I will say, as of late I have started to feel nostalgic and more connected with my dad's music. My dad's music taste is based a lot on the ’80s and 90’s music, growing up I heard a lot of A-HA, Foo Fighters, George Michael, Phil Collins, Prince, Michael Jackson, and of course the various random one-hit wonder bands of that era as well that I just can’t seem to name right now. Now I like all the artists I mentioned above, but the two that make me feel nostalgic would have to be Foo Fighters and George Michael. Foo Fighters is responsible for making my favorite rock album of all time, this is due to my dad playing songs like “My Hero” and “Everlong” all the time back in the day. It was the first time I had ever seen my father dissect the meaning and lyrics of a song and try to tell me something about it. Seeing him become passionate about a song was something I was annoyed by as a child, but as I grew into my own being I find that passion to mean a lot, especially coming from my dad who isn’t as into music as I am. It really felt like a full circle moment when the feelings my dad had for the music became the feelings I have for the music, and it makes me nostalgic for the days he would play that album in his pickup truck. The second album is George Michael’s “Ladies and Gentleman… the best of George Michael”. This album was just a compilation of some of his biggest hits. We had this one on CD and as a kid, I had no idea half the songs on here were about sex, but I really loved the music. This was the album we would pop in the car and drive around on a sunny day with no destination. Hearing songs like “Don't Let the sun come down on Me” as you are cruising in the back seat as the sunsets on the most scenic road you have ever laid your eyes on. It was a moment that felt straight out of a movie for me. What makes George Michael’s music special to me is that it is dramatic enough to make a moment special without taking you out of the moment. He has songs that I would argue are objectively perfect or at least perfect for specific moments. This CD made me appreciate music the same way I appreciate wine today, it is something that only elevates life. Overall I think the nostalgia for my dad’s music taste ultimately lies in the fact I am getting older and I have my own taste now, but whenever I overlap with my father in songs it always feels special to me. We are two drastically different people but even we can find some common ground and I truly think that is fantastic.</p>

  <p class="blog">Nostalgia is a great feeling, I view it like an elegant dish rather than a tube of fast food that is constantly being fed to us. The feeling of nostalgia has to come up naturally through our own brain recognition, not just through some internet post trying to force positive memories to keep you complacent in life. Nostalgia is a feeling that should make you thankful for the journey because it brought you to where you are now, not because you want to drive back. The truth of the matter is for most of us are still young and can achieve many more memories that can fuel our future nostalgia, so let’s keep driving </p>

  <h2>YOU ARE LISTENING TO MUSIC WRONG</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">	Hello everyone, sorry for the lack of posts I have been superrrrrr busy hahahahha but I am back #yipeee. During my little hiatus, I have been feeling a heavy amount of numbness and a lack of inspiration. As of late it feels like all my passions have been on the decline, I have been drawing less, writing less, and making music less. My lack of production on the things I love only added to my lack of inspiration which in turn only made it harder for me to get back into them. But after a well-deserved spring break, I am feeling recharged and excited to do things again. One of the things that made me find a new stride in my life is music, now anyone who knows me personally knows I love me some music. But before spring break I just found myself not even enjoying some of my favorite artists like I used to. After the Rihanna halftime show, I thought for sure I would stream all her music but I barely even felt the itch to touch her discog. Even Aubrey (drake) Grahm was someone I felt sick of, and I know that sentence made a lot of you drake #haters happy, but I got some news for yall now! I love music again (including drake ahahhahaha). So what changed in my life to make me enjoy these things again? Well, I personally believe there are 3 factors that affect your feeling about a song outside of the song itself.</p>
     
   <center> <input onclick="change16()" value="Show More" ID="button16" type="submit" class="collapse16" style="cursor: url(custompointer.png), auto; position:relative; top:50%; margin: 0 auto; display:inline-block; width:30vw;height:30px;color:white; background-color:black;"/>
 

<div class="container"
    style="display:none;">
<!--Insert the rest of your blog's text here!-->
    <p class="blog">	The first factor is the scenery. Music is meant to be the soundtrack to our own lives and if our movies take place in the same 3 sets then we are bound to feel that our score is out of place. I love future but his music simply doesn't hit the same when I am on my college campus, or when I am listening to Call me if you get lost in the cold ass streets of Richmond I am bound to feel a disconnect to the music. Just like a movie score, our songs should enhance the places we are at instead of taking us away from them. For me personally, a change of scenery was necessary since 2023 started I have rarely been outside, but as soon as I went outside I found that a change of scenery enhanced my music listening so much. I was bumping that new kali uchis album on the beach and it was so gorgeous I genuinely felt like I was in heaven. You don't have to travel too far though to change your scenery though. Sometimes all you need is a nighttime drive, or a walk through the park to find a new appreciation for not just the music but life itself. One of my favorite things to do is go to the art museum and play Aphex Twin, it just enhances my experience so much more. Or when I cook I like to play bossa nova. So to conclude I feel a change of scenery can enhance your life and music so much more.</p>

  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
   
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	The next factor is movement, whether you are driving, fucking, or dancing you are still moving. Music in its base factor is built on rhythms and beats (even taylor swift, unfortunately) and our society has become more and more sedentary as time and technology have progressed. I want you to dance IDC if you are bad at it, just bust a move and you will not only hear the music, but you will also feel it. Usually, when new music drops it is midnight on a Thursday night and I am in my room. of course, I can't just start dancing around like a lunatic my neighbors are trying to sleep. So now usually on the first listens I try to head bump or do some little hand movements just as a way to feel the rhythm more, but for some albums, I can't fully get a grasp on them until I can actually fully move and dance. Drakes honestly nevermind is a great example of this. The amount of love I have for this album is genuinely stupid, but it dropped in the summer and I was literally traveling when the album dropped. My first listen I was in a hotel room rocking getting hyped in my bed. The next day though that is when the album had a new level for me, as I was going home from the airport I had songs like "flights booked", "Sticky" and "Jimmy Cooks" on repeat. and I started to feel the album on a personal level. Seeing the wings of a plane while drake sings in the most hypnotic way possible on flights booked is a memory I will forever hold when it comes to travel and now I do it every time I am on a plane. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	The last factor is mindset. In the era of social media and short attention spans it feels so important to be able to stay on the most current event. In turn, though this has destroyed a lot of enjoyment in media. I had a script for a video I scrapped about the problem with oversaturation, but basically one of the points I made was how we value the power of holding a first take. How we want to set a trend of opinions. When Lil Yachty dropped his album this year everyone on Twitter was singing its praises saying how generational he is as an artist, but now nobody is talking about the album anymore. The music discourse on social media has become a cycle of chewing and spitting when really music is a meal. We are allowed to have first impressions but when you take a first impression as the fact you may fail to see what lies beyond your initial perception of the art. On the other side of things, we have the dangers of over-dissecting music. I notice this problem more so with me and my friends who make music, a musician's ear, and mind are far pickier on things than the average fan (not to sound snobby of course). This pickiness is important to have especially when it comes to elevating your own craft, I wouldn't trust a chef whose favorite restaurant is McDonald's, but on the flip side, this criticalness can lead to a loss of love and passion for the art. the music can feel like a job and at that point, the cynicism and disdain have completely taken over. I have had that feeling personally I have had an era where I genuinely didn't like a lot of the music coming out. I had to change my mindset for some albums in order to enjoy them again. I realized not every album is a Michelin star meal, sometimes fast food is good. Albums this year like trippie redd and YB have a lot of tracks but don't really say much as an album. Yet I was able to find enjoyment in them by turning off my mind and just feeling the energy. That trippie redd album sounded so good to me while I was playing MW2, and I'm a grown-ass man I don't listen to trippie at all but that night it just hit different.  Some music on the other hand is rewarding to dissect. For me personally, Vince Staples's Ramona Park Broke my heart has become my favorite album of all time due to my dissection and analysis of the album. the beauty of the music is you can make it as deep as you want it and to me, that album has significant meaning that I can bore you all day about, but that's a post for another time.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Thank you so much for reading my article it feels good to be writing again. I forgot how much I enjoyed this. In other random life updates, I am picking up drawing again, doing Judo tomorrow, hitting the gym consistently and I am trying to get back into the swing of music. I have a plan for my music and I don't wanna let myself down, but with my mood feeling motivated again and my music sounding perfect I have no doubt that I can do it. Thank ya so much again for reading and have a great day !!!</p>

  <h2>Fish & Resolutions | The Pink Fish Theory</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">	Just yesterday I was feeding my fish at my dad's house. Due to winter break, I have spent a lot more time at home than usual, so seeing all my pets is a nice perk. I love all my pets from my loud old-ass Yorkie who is still full of life and will do anything for food, my loving and loyal cat, and my dad's socially awkward German Shepard. I love them all and see that they have great and unique personalities. However, there is one pet I have yet to mention and that is my pet fish, it is a pink kissing gourami and in its 14-year life, we have never given it a definitive name. The fish was one of the original fish I got as a little kid and has seen some absolute horror movie-level shit. I used to have a catfish that legit ate a solid 5 fish and even cut up the pink kisser. I later ended up lamenting that damn catfish when he ate my school of colorful fish that I colorfully called the skittle squad. After the catfish finally passed all that remained was the pink kisser in the tank that doubled as both a graveyard and a prison. 14 years spent in the same four corners and everyone they knew they saw die. What was its purpose for living? Matter of fact the tank they reside in is too small, when I educated myself more on fish care I realized that the pink kissing gourami needs to live in a 75-gallon tank while the tank I own is a measly 10 gal. Fish living in undersized tanks literally implode due to their organs growing larger than their body allows... yet mine still stands. This isn't a flex or me being a sociopath, I got this fish when I was just a kid and PetSmart markets Fish more as fashion accessories rather than a serious responsibility. They let me and encouraged me to get a big selection for that tiny ass tank and my excited ass obliged. The 75-gallon tank is expensive and takes up too much space, and I can't just let the fish out in the wild for it will surely die due to not knowing how to hunt. I decided that its best course of action is just to coast it out and eventually die.

    <p class="blog">	Now, what does this have to do with resolutions? well traditionally I have never been a new years fan, I used to think that people never really changed from their "true nature". However, through my own personal growth and the countless transformations I have seen firsthand, I have found a new perception of life. We can change in fact it is what we are supposed to do. As quoted by John Henry Patterson "Only fools and dead men don't change their minds. Fools won't. Dead men can't.". I was a fool, stubborn in my own ways and ideals, but I am genuinely glad I am starting to be more open to new ideas and philosophies. One thing that is a sign of my newfound openness is my new love for holidays and their symbolic meanings. Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's have all found a new meaning for me and have made me appreciate life and the people in it far more than I could have ever imagined.     </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	New Year's is great because it is a symbolic fresh start. People who tend to detest the day have a problem of framing it wrong. They tend to frame it as a fresh start from their problems, while in actuality it is a fresh start for your own mind. Outside nothing changes and you can never truly control it anyways, the only thing you can control is yourself and the decisions you make. It is up to you to not only set goals and standards for yourself but to also maintain and improve upon them. That level of accountability and responsibility excites me personally as a true way to challenge and measure my own growth. So for this new year, I would like to make some solid resolutions and plan them out.</p>

<p class="blog"><i><b>Part I. the physical</b></i></p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	Okay, this one is probably the easiest to state, but hardest to maintain, but I want to get a workout routine going. where I work at least 4 times a week. I do not wish to be a big muscle man, but I would love a leaner body. I will also be holding myself to a far stricter diet. while I usually don't eat a lot, what I do eat tends to be rather unhealthy. I need to cut down on candy and fast food and increase my intake of vegetables and fruits. My ultimate goal with this regiment isn't to get all the bad bitches or whatever... I just want to be able to kick my brother's ass again.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="blog"><i><b>Part II. the arts</b></i></p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	Storytime, back in middle school I used to take a karate class, and every day after school this bus would pick my brother and me up. The bus was filled with my fellow peers and it drove us to the dojo, now one of my peers was a kid named Ian. Ian had a chipmunk ass head and would always be joking around. He was super funny and I would laugh my ass off on that bus. one of those days the bus hit a speed bump and that kid Ian had his cheeks bust a whole emote. I have never seen cheeks move like that and I genuinely laughed at it for a solid 30 minutes and it became one of the best jokes on that bus. That is when my inspiration struck. I had a spare spiral notebook at home and quickly started making my comic book based around Ian and his fat cheeks. On the bus, I would talk to Ian about his life and whatnot and I would use that as inspiration for this whole world I created. He would tell me about this annoying girl in his school named Mariah who bullies him, so I made her my main antagonist, his sidekick was his real-life best friend and our sensei was his master in the comic who would yell at him and pester him about everything. The story I crafted was very nonsensical and I wore my inspirations on my sleeve without a doubt. The original trilogy of Ian comics was inspired by Captain Underpants, Star Wars, and Adventure time. Oddly enough though looking back on the character I do find a lot of similarities between Ian and Luffy, Especially with their body-stretching fighting styles and goofy personalities. Now that story aside, we come to the question... "what do I want to do?". I want to learn how to draw and eventually make my own comic. I want to create a grand story that spans multiple volumes and chapters, Something that will entertain me and my taste because as a kid I was not a fan of reading, but I would laugh my ass off at my own comics. is it narcissistic? Probably, but if I don't like what I'm making then why would I even make it?</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="blog"><i><b>Part III. The Mental</b></i></p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	Okay, so if you read my "I dropped an album" and my "I Fucking Love One Piece" articles then you would have seen I identified some things that I changed mentally, but I would like to add onto that as well. This year I want to find the beauty in everything, I am sick of hating things, so I will push my taste to a new level and find to time to enjoy the journey of greatness more than the results of it. I want to be optimistic to try everything and even when I don't succeed I don't want to be deterred. I want to enjoy the process of learning just as much as mastering things.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="blog"><i><b>The Pink Fish Theory</b></i></p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	My Fish and Vince Staples, are to be credited for this theory I am about to present. We are all fish in tanks that are too small for us. The tank is a metaphor for our mindset and the fish is ourselves, mind > matter. We need to constantly evolve and grow our minds or else we will die. death in a spiritual sense, as a state of stillness in development. The beauty of it all is that we only have to focus on growing our minds rather than our physical bodies. When you give the fish a bigger thank it will allow it to naturally grow. Same with our own bodies, when you have big goals and a positive mindset then you will find yourself unconsciously growing and becoming stronger. we are designed to dream bigger than what we are, just like the fish cannot be bigger than the tank it is in. Thank you so much and have a happy new year. I hope that all your goals and plans are set in motion and that you continue to grow. - MouSa.</p>

  <h2>I FUCKING LOVE ONE PIECE</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">Well hello again, it's me, Mousa. Now as some of you may or may not know I have been on a short little hiatus from the internet (well social media). During my break, I have decided to catch up on many things. I have decided to read more (currently taking book recommendations), self-care through exercise and therapy as well as eating better, and lastly I have been watching a lot of anime. Mostly Naruto, Mob Psycho, and now possibly one of my new favorite anime <b>One Piece</b>. through a mixture of reading the manga and watching the episodes at night, I have been able to get to the middle of the Arabasta arc (episode 117 in the anime). Without a doubt, I have never felt so touched before emotionally when watching tv. Oda is able to craft a world that is so inviting and truly encourages me to push harder and be better. When I see Luffy proclaim his dreams of being the pirate king I find myself gaining confidence in my own dreams.</p>

    <p class="blog">	Of course, to truly achieve those dreams you don't only need confidence in yourself but you also need confidence and trust in those around you. This is where I personally fell short in the past and I apologize I should trust some of yall more. My distrust didn't come from a false superiority but more so a fear of nobody being able to truly relate to me. Thankfully though seeing the straw hat pirates gain each other's trust I felt myself being more open vicariously. Every Straw hat I have met (so far) has taught me a valuable lesson, Luffy taught me I can take on the world with a good attitude and a good group of people. Zoro taught me the power of will and self-discipline and at times during my hiatus, I truly felt like him. Nami taught me how to trust people you initially didn't like at all. Sanji taught me about the purity of positive emotions like love and bonds. Tony Tony Chopper taught me about fighting for a cause despite the odds like a true pirate. IDGAF bout how cringe this shit sounds A MF LIKE I actually cried watching this show so many times. When Luffy called on Nami in arlong park, Chopper's backstory, hell even the damn dog from the first arc had me crying. Oh wait I forgot Usopp... ermm I like dude but he be lying too much tbh lol I was already good at lying before though so maybe he gets braver later in the show. I love all the straw hat pirates and I will not forget what they represent to me.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Tying it all together now. I am back on the internet now but not as an escape from my reality which had only caused my existential angst and fears, but more so as a way to truly solidify my bonds to the outside world. The truth of the matter is I was good alone I found a job now, I am talking to a therapist right now and I have been on top of my assignments, while this may be good I am in search of better. What I truly value in my life is an adventure, and while I don't truly know where it will take me I am sure as hell to enjoy the company and stories along the way. In the end, it isn't the one with the most power who is the happiest, it is the one who is the freest. I am in search of my freedom and I can't achieve the goal without my crew. and there will always be room for you if you want to be my friend.</p>
