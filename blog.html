    <p class="blog">I have added a "comics" and a "music" page. The comics page is for silly doodles and comics I make. I used to draw a lot of comics as a kid and only recently have I rediscovered my love for drawing comics. These will be silly comic strips a la newspaper gags.</p>

    <p class="blog">The music page is far more interesting to me, I will create a curated page soley for my personal mixes, and other misc projects that I would have never put onto streaming. I want to experiment with sound more and having a platform like my website is truly helpful for my confidence, I love this site because there is not numbers, or corporate UI. Everything here is according to my own vision, so I would like my personal art to be a home here as well.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Thank you for your continued support and love. I hope you enjoy my direction! I am learning so many new and more advanced things in coding and I hope to turn all my dreams into reality one day!!!</p>

  <h2>Marketing Network Event Notes & Reflection</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">
  Recently I have been blessed with an opportunity to speak to many people in the marketing industry. First, I would like to thank VCU and every teacher, faculty, and professional involved in ensuring this happened. I had a great time and I learned so much. In this short blog post, I would like to give you my reflections and main takeaways from the event. </p>
     
   <center> <input onclick="change4()" value="Show More" ID="button4" type="submit" class="collapse4" style="cursor: url(custompointer.png), auto; position:relative; top:50%; margin: 0 auto; display:inline-block; width:30vw;height:30px;color:white; background-color:black;"/>
 

<div class="container"
    style="display:none;">
<!--Insert the rest of your blog's text here!-->
    <p class="blog"> The first point to make was the importance of networking, currently, my heart lies on moving this summer, so hearing people give me real advice on how to meet people and connect has helped build my confidence in getting myself out there more. I enjoy this process of my life a lot and meeting new people and making connections is paramount to my growth. You can’t just only connect with your peers, you need to also connect with more experienced people to find mentors who have been in fields you want to be in. The experience of time mixed with the ambition of youth is a balance needed to achieve greatness, not just in the corporate world but in life as a whole I believe. With these connections you must avoid comparing yourself to others, you shouldn’t be the smartest person in every room you walk into, that is a sign of insecurity if anything. Get used to not being the best because it will only give you a hunger to learn and cooperate with others. Lean on mentors and learn as much as you can. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
   <p class="blog">Speaking of learning, this is the next point I wish to address. We are lifetime learners, and my life as a student will never end even when I graduate this May. Learn and get certified in software like Excel, Tableau, Photoshop, or whatever the industry standard is for your career. Software is always coming out and you need to be able to adapt and learn new processes because the truth of life is that we are always looking to maximize efficiency so you can’t afford to not adjust to the times. Google has a free night school called “D&AD Shift” where you can get online certifications that will look good on a resume as well as help you learn new things.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Another thing to note is that creativity is important everywhere, even in things like data analytics, you need to think creatively and tell a story out of the data you have. For example, if you see a trend in one thing losing popularity, it is not enough to say “that thing is trending downwards in popularity”, because guess what? An AI can say that same exact thing now, and it is scary to think about a robot taking out a big part of the job market. So in order to rise above AI, you need to master “soft skills”, these are skills that a computer can never have like speaking, presentations, creativity, and personality. You need to stand out not only with your brain but also with your personality now. This is why creativity is so important. You aren’t different anymore, you are instead someone who stands out!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">The last conference I attended was a selling one. Marketing and sales have a close relationship and I think through sales you can learn a lot of those “soft skills” that marketing doesn’t ever really teach you. In the sales panel, I learned the importance of not only upward mobility but also horizontal mobility, many sales positions are just ways to get your foot in the door to land that marketing job you want so badly. I will consider applying for sales jobs because the mentality they give you is something I truly respect. In sales, you will learn the value of self-motivation and ambition, due to the commission-based pay and personality-driven challenges.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Overall I had a great time and learned a lot, I would like to thank VCU again for this amazing opportunity. If you would like to connect with me then please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or send me an email. I am excited to continue my journey and I hope that what I learned today is not only helpful to me but helpful to you as well.</p>

  <h2>Confidence is reassurance, not entitlement</h2>

 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">
  Good day to everyone reading this. First I would like to shout out myself for making it, I am the best this is my website, this is my blog and nobody is doing it like me in 2024, I am soooo go—<i>*INCORRECT BUZZER SOUND*</i>. Okay now for real though, hello everyone thank you so much for reading my blog today on my new website. I am still very much excited about everything right now, but today I would like to speak on the dangers of not understanding what true confidence is. </p>

    <p class="blog"> As of late, I have been moving a lot in both my professional and creative spaces. It has gotten to the point where I wake up and instantly go to work. This has been a great flow for me in the past and it helped me build myself up again due to my previous experiences of hopelessness that I expressed in my previous blog. For me working makes me feel good, when I make progress it is hard to not get excited. If anything it is good to get excited, but I started to get this rush, a feeling of superiority.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">When it comes to art I have a fatal flaw, when I start getting things in place I genuinely start to feel like a god. Like I need to throw water on my face to chill out because I get so hyped about myself that it blinds me from areas I can improve upon. I know this flaw is not who I am, because of how much I hate that side of me. I needed to understand what true confidence is. To me, confidence is reassurance, not entitlement.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Before we understand reassurance we first must contextualize confidence as entitlement. Confidence as entitlement lives solely in the ego. You are confident because you think you deserve praise due to your own greatness, You chant mantras of being the “G.O.A.T” but you average 31 monthly listeners</p>
    <br>
    <img src="/images/mousaspotify.PNG" style="width: 90%;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog"> Shameless self-plug aside, this mindset is dangerous because it forces you to rely on outside validation as well as generates a false sense of superiority. The truth of the matter is you are not the G.O.A.T and the next time you drop there is always a chance that nobody will be moved by it. It doesnt matter who you are because it can happen to anyone and everyone. So is it still confidence if it only makes you more vulnerable and limits your own growth? Of course not, this is just a loud insecurity.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">I have fallen in that trap a plenty before, and it just leads to an inevitable cruel taste of reality. Well, it is only cruel if you believe in the delusions of grandeur your mind generates for you. This is why I have decided to practice what true confidence is. The confidence in self-reassurance changed my entire perspective on everything and has made me enjoy what I do again in every field.</p>
    <br> 
    <p class="blog">True confidence has to come from within and is built around the belief that YOU can build yourself up and improve. This true confidence doesn’t blind you from flaws but instead makes you more open to hearing criticism and working on yourself. Often times the most confident people are the quietest. You have nothing to prove when you are confident and make every move for the sake of what you like. I am now a confident creator, in everything I make I am a fan of it now, I know it is flawed and I can take criticism because I love my work so much that I just want to get better.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">This is why I created my chop wood carry water series, my website, and my blogs. I no longer fear perception, if anything being perceived will only make me see my own flaws. The only way we can prove our existence to ourselves is through the lens of others. I exist because I’m here, but I know I’m real because I am seen. Whatever reaction I get from being seen doesn’t affect me because of the strength I get from being seen. To me, that is the ultimate reassurance. I have the power to put myself out there and it doesn’t matter what happens because I feel good about it at the end.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">People are important to the creative process and you need a good balance of those who are fans, and those who are critical of you. But to take you’re strength from their perception will ultimately lead to a dangerous crash out.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Thank you for reading this blog, I will be taking a rest this week, but in the meantime please enjoy my website, as well as watch my latest YouTube video (linked below).</p>

    <h2>Cinema Outside the big screen</h2>

   <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
   <p class="blog">
    As of late, I have been a huge fan of films and movies. I am borderline a film buff, the only difference between me and them is that I don't pay for letterbox pro hahaha. the word cinematic means a lot to me because to me it means larger than life. and as someone alive, I can say that being larger than life means it is HUGE. The art of being cinematic in movies is hard enough, but to translate that feeling into other art forms is just jaw-droppingly impressive. Today I would like to shine the spotlight on some of my favorite cinematic pieces of work that aren't movies. </p>

      <p class="blog">This might be my favorite thing Fujimoto has ever made. This short one-shot story is a real-life love letter to films in the form of a manga. The manga opens up with a kid named Yuta who is filming his mother's death. It is a slow and emotional opening. Fujimoto uses this technique of repetition in manga panels in order to create this film reel effect that just adds to the feeling of it being a movie. Another thing that is cool is the use of motion blur and the camera quality in this section compared to the rest of the manga. It is all so very interesting and makes this manga feel more authentic. take a look at this</p>

      <p class="blog"> And boom we made it to the ultimate reveal, this was a film competition. the explosion was just part of the movie, and we get back to reality. but this does not stop the cinematics from existing as Yuta continues to film in the real world as well. with these next images please notice when the in-universe camera starts recording </p>

      <p class="blog">The manga continues to do this through its run time and just gets wilder as we get deeper into the plot. I only wanted to speak on the first few pages because I do not wish to spoil anything. Please go read this, it is my favorite manga ever and I am so glad Fujimoto continued to use the repetition motif in Chainsaw Man Part 2, i love how cinematic his work is.</p>
      <p class="blog">2) Music</p>
      <p class="blog">Music can 100% be cinematic, as of late I have fallen deep in love with the idea of a concept album. a concept album is an album that focuses on one central idea and theme. these albums tend to follow a character as they go through a journey and we find the start and end of the album to be drastically different in terms of mindstates.
"Mr.Morale and the Big Steppers" is a great example of a concept album with a character. the main theme of the album is generational trauma as well as external pressure. Kendrick uses himself as a character to make something that is both personal and relatable. the first disc on this project focuses on the problems Kendrick has. the first track serves as a perfect introduction to the elusive Kendrick, we learn that he has been going through something over one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five days and follows it with the phrase "be afraid". this builds the listener's curiosity. the following tracks are aggressive and brutal in terms of subject matter, N95 and Worldwide Steppers are about Kendrick's insecurities and vices. N95 Kendrick asks "Where the hypocrites at" as he uses the track to criticize the general rap community for fake activism and overall lack of realness. this goes into worldwide steppers being a personal confession of Kendricks's lust addiction. this humanizes Kendrick and makes us realize that Kendrick is also feeling guilty about the reason why the world is that way. Diehard is him pleading that is not too late to fix himself, but when he is faced with the solution of therapy he sends a rebuttal of his not needing into therapy,  as the next track "Father Time plays". This next arc of the album has rich spirit, celebrating what Kendrick has gone through and how he is thankful that he is who he is. This keeps him distracted from his problems. We are ultimately hit with a wall where we see that it is all a front, "we cry together" is an example of how his view of women and past trauma has changed his view of women and relationships. The final word on "We Cry Together" is to stop tap dancing around the conversation. Tap dancing is a motif throughout the album and is most prevalent on tracks where Kendrick is directly talking to the listener. "savior" on disc 2 is a great example of the tap dance motif. Kendrick gives the listener the truth of not idolizing these rappers (and LeBron) and after every statement comes tap dancing. It is a way to tell the listener to pay attention and not to tap dance around the truth. the 2nd disc overall is titled Breakthrough and it circles around Kendrick realizing the trauma and problems in his life are something he needs to tackle. "Auntie Diaries" is a story about him recalling his experience of being insensitive to a trans family member but growing up and accepting them. "Mother I Sober" is a track where he finally comes to realize that he does need help, the sober truth is a powerful one. "Mirror" is the outro and Kendrick comes full circle and realizes that he is not the listener's savior, and wants to focus on building his own life. I love this album so much man, it grew on me heavily because I truly can relate to some of the things he says, which is something I could never really say with his music.</p>
      <p class="blog">3) Video Games</p>
      <p class="blog">Video games have come a long way since being about virtual tennis, we now have virtual tennis with silly characters :D. but in all seriousness video games are a valid art form and can be a great tool for someone to experience a story. I can pick a lot of great examples of great cinematic games, but I think my recent favorite video game of mine would be "Stray". the game sort of fell into a strange realm of being overhyped, but it is talked about for the wrong reasons in my opinion. I like playing as a silly cat more than anyone else I know, but we fail to see the bigger picture and true beauty of the game.</p>
      <img src="https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/16162533/SEI_118880616.jpg?crop=16:9,smart&width=1200&height=675&upscale=true" style="width: 90%;
      display: block;
      margin: 0 auto;">
      <p class="blog">what made this game feel so cinematic to me was its amazing score and use of lighting. exploring the game world felt fun and rewarding even if the gameplay was really basic. Games like these are often criticized for being style over substance, but I personally find a lot of enjoyment in these short experiences where everything in the world has a purpose rather than a huge open-world triple-A mess with bugs and stupid shit. I like a short game, i am a grown-ass man if I am playing a game alone best believe it is something with a dope story. It's hard for me to really explain the beauty of stray without just recommending you to play it for yourself. it is a really short and replayable game that I can tackle on a sick day so I recommend you play it in one sitting too.</p>
      <p class="blog">4) Life</p>
      <p class="blog">Life is the ultimate piece of cinema if you make it one. There are moments in life that feel so grand and meaningful. This one is the hardest feeling to capture, but the sweetest one to feel. In life, there isn't editing and countless teams working to give you the perfect lighting, dialogue, and emotions, sometimes it just happens and when it happens naturally it feels truly ethereal. Of course, since these moments happen without planning it is our job as people to pay attention and live in the present. today is the best gift we can ever receive and nothing about it should be taken for granted. This was a lesson I had to learn for myself, in my damn near 22 years of living it feels like I have seen a lot. The truth is nobody truly knows my full story even those I'm closest to, I can just wake up and drop a truth bomb on my family and friends if I so choose to do so. I find that aspect to be empowering personally, people find me charming and captivating for the person I present myself as more so than the story that lies underneath. With that power and knowledge I bestow though it can come to hurt me, for a while it felt like nothing was exciting me. I hate college in all honesty, I am just too locked into getting this degree to complain about it. I became someone who only seeks satisfaction from my stress, because in my mind in the end it will all be worth it. If I wasn't working then I was dying, this is how I felt. Hanging out with friends, and making art, it all felt pointless to me for a bit, mentally I just had leaving on my mind. I have recently come to realize that, my old way of viewing the world was just a delayed suicide, I was losing the joy in my life because I have truly felt like I have seen and done it all. I was bored, but I was bored because I made it boring. my constant worrying about the future led me to never enjoy the present.</p>
      <p class="blog">Mentally I had to change; I decided to take reading and enjoying art into my life again. With these inspirations in my life, I started to notice parallels, after all, life imitates art. "What do I mean by this?" you may be asking. Well allow me to explain with an analogy, I used to view my life as if I were an anime character in a shitty shonen anime. I didn't even view myself as a main character I felt like a side character whose only two plots are working or the stupid "filler episodes" where I would do something with my life that truly didn't affect me in the slightest. Filler arcs for me were things like playing video games, consistently sleeping, drinking, and just being a degenerate. My character didn't grow or change as much the work I did just funded the fillers leaving me back at 0. I felt a void in my soul, I would justify my filler arcs by stating "Oh I worked so hard I deserve this" not realizing that said fillers are the reason I go back to 0.</p>
      <p class="blog">Now I view my life as a director, and whatever I make is my choice. Being a director allows you to dictate how your own story goes. My pain from working isn't just what I am about, it is instead development for me, and I reinvest that pain into motivating myself to grow and mature. Classic tropes of storytelling like the hero's journey are something you can and should apply to your life. it is a journey you will go on when facing anything in life, and when you anticipate and plan out how your story is then you can find true enjoyment in the process of getting to the end of enlightenment. You are the director of your life, so give yourself a direction and enjoy every step of the process because it is these trials that will make you better than you were.</p>

      margin: 0 auto;">
      <p class="blog">This is why people don't find life cinematic. We all make goals and have dreams but we fail to plan the steps in between. I want to play the piano but thinking about practicing it makes me want to die, this was a mindset I used to have, and it made the world feel all the more cruel and uninspired. The mindset is you need to chop wood and carry water. That means you need to enjoy the process of becoming great. Find the beauty in practicing that piano and contrast it with the hero's journey to plot your progress. Figure out why you want to be great and let it motivate you, when you have a purpose everything matters, and when everything matters that is when you have a cinematic moment.</p>
      <p class="blog">So next time you are feeling life is dull, just look around and realize 1) am I where I want to be and 2) how can I change. once you set that plan take one last look around, look at the colors of your life, and the sounds, and contrast them with movies you have seen and you will find parallels. Same with your growth this is your training montage in real time, and the payoff is the rewarding climax. Once you reach the end of that arc, it doesn't mean your story is over. Remember you are the director and when you are ready it is on you to start your next project. So be sure to enjoy it all</p>

 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">
  Despite my disappointment in some albums, I found many new albums this year that I genuinely love. If some of these albums dropped in other years they might even be my AOTY for them, so ranking them this year has been hard. For this list, I am ranking off my personal enjoyment of each album, so I don't expect everyone to agree with my list, but that is what makes music fun, I enjoy talking about what I like far more than what I don't like, I also enjoy hearing what you like as well, even if I don't have it on my list I am curious to know what did yall spin this year. anyways ramble out the way let's get into the list</p>

    <h2>10) Genesis - Peso Pluma</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTGtYlbAmEsm2vjc2UAVfNjFLx_fGUn_VwLLw&s" style="size-adjust: 50%;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	Peso Pluma undoubtedly had one of the biggest years for an artist in terms of blowing up, but numbers aside I would like to spotlight his album. Genesis is a phenomenal album that combines ballads, urban and cartel-influenced music so well that the album gives off a rich texture filled with culture and passion. The track "Lagunas" is my favorite, it's an emotional and somber ballad about him missing a woman that he had to split from for the sake of both of them, In the chorus he talks about how in his mind he likes to think that in another universe they got together and were happy. Other tracks like "Prc" have great energy that just makes me want to dance, the music feels like a live recording in a good way. the way the band is mixed in with the vocals, as opposed to the vocals feeling on top of the instrumentation.  it's something you will get when you listen to the music, the energy just translates so well without the need to be overproduced and that is definitely his strongest attribute. I highly recommend this album, it might even be higher on my list if i spoke Spanish tbh, but as someone who is not fluent in the language, I can still say I really love this project.</p>
   
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>9) E O - Cero</h2>
    <img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2296195987_10.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
    <p class="blog">	I was going to gatekeep this one tbh, but that wouldn't be right because I found this album from a friend posting it on their story. This is a Japanese art pop record filled with ambient strings, psychedelic keys, and relaxed production, all these elements collide with the calming and even somber vocals really well. This is one of those albums that feels like the album cover and I think that is my favorite thing music can do, other projects on this list also do this really well as well, but I will get to those later. I really don't know any of the lyrics but the vocal delivery on the last track is just cinematic, it's absolutely gorgeous and feels like an emotional climax to an album that takes you on a journey from sunrise to sunset in a small oceanside town in Japan. I like to think the last track is waking up from a dream, or maybe entering a new one, maybe it is a metaphor for death and that's why the album cover is so fuzzy like a fading memory. despite it being over you can still feel it inside you still. You can never really lose a memory if it changes you in the end. but i could be 1000% wrong here and the album could be about hot dogs for all i know, I still love this project. </p>

<h2>8) l3ft 4 d3ad - Hi-C</h2>
<img src="https://images.genius.com/592e53c2f312f4d3f46dafa30f1bd05d.1000x1000x1.png" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">Hi-C is an artist you either love or you hate. I personally think his music goes insanely hard. This project has Hi-C rapping at probably his peak, I personally like melodic Hi-C more like on the Lonestar mixtape, but I still really enjoyed l3ft 4 d3ad. D3us 3x is a great track the beat is just so hard and Hi-C raps with such confidence that whatever he says sounds hard. Parano1d Hi-C takes a shot at Diamonds on my dick and actually destroys him he said "Pushing 30 tryna fuck on a teen got exposed on the gram whole world know you a creep" and "I can't pass her to you, you give hoes STDs". I love it when an artist doesn't rock with pedophiles cough cough (A$AP Rocky). Hi-C is just hard asf man, i really love Hi-C music, I went to the grocery store today to buy Hi-C drink just to feel more like him.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>7) Metropolis - Kahlil Blu</h2>
<img src="https://www19.hiphopde.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Metropolis-Kahlil-Blu.webp" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	Metropolis is the 3rd album from Kahlil Blu and it is easily his best work yet. This album shines in its versatility 22 songs but they all got different sounds. The title track is a great example of his talent, the beat starts off with this great piano sample and he just starts rapping the flow is tight and the chorus is mad catchy, then the beat switches to this pro era type boom bap beat and he slaughters it too. there are other types of music too, jersey club in "NO TIME" and "ANNOYED", Alt-rock in "MIDNIGHT MAN" and Rage inspiration in "Memory". Overall the variety is dope and he self-produces his stuff too which just adds to his uniqueness.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>6) Lovesick - Don Toliver</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/50/Love_Sick.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	Don Toliver is an artist that I never really gassed up like at all, like i fw his first project and what he did on "Moon" is still generational so when he dropped his new project i was not too hyped at first, especially since i found his last album to feel just like expensive sound. to me he always made music that sounded good but never really said anything. This album though I was really surprised, the main theme of this album is relationships the ups and downs of it, its mostly just lust though in all honesty, but its an improvement for sure. As for the music mannn I love this project Don Toliver varies his production and gets acoustic on some tracks which is a welcome change, he lets his vocals contrast with the production instead of sounding like another part of it. "Leathercoat" is a great song he does this flow around the 2-minute mark that is just so smooth, "Bus Stop" is a jersey-inspired dance track with Brent and it is just as fun as it sounds, and "Encouragement" is just a really smooth closing track Don sounds very charismatic and it really feels like a victory lap for him. Last but not least I need to shout out the best song on the album "Go Down" which interpolates tisa koreans backseat and Don's vocals over that beat just feel like a perfect match and Don was so real for showing Tisa love.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>5) Loreseeker - bbygoyard</h2>
<img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3180125769_65" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	Bbygoyard dropped 3 projects this year, but this one is easily his best. Loreseeker is a great listen, I love the radio-style presentation of the album plus DJ Smokey's tags are just funny. This is not to take away from the songs by any means though the soundscape of this album is intense, "Now I've Become Death" is a drum n bass song that goes insane in the car, "Save Urself" has these guitars that just bleed in the mix and Bbygoyard has such a spiteful delivery that the song just feels evil in a good way. I'll say my favorite song is the final track "So Much for a Pleasant Goodbye" has elements of vaporware, shoegaze and rock, and it creates this just momentous and emotional closing track. It is very impressive how great it sounds actually especially if you come into the project only knowing him for his funny tiktok song.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>4) Mid-Air - Paris Texas</h2>
  <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcToI1vd9wtN96lVQ4FYCyBPNCtO5CWJnQwQ2g&s" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	Originally this album was number 5 for me but I read an article saying Richie from "The Bear" had this album in his top 5 THINGS of 2023. top 5 THINGS btw not ALBUMS, but THINGS like that's hugeeee so I had to revisit this project, and I saw the hype. when this first dropped I didn't even like it for real. It took me until August to get the album and once I got it I just loved it. This is a real-life Rap/Rock album and it really bangs. the first 2 tracks flow together so nicely that it feels like one song and they both hit hard. The third track "DnD" got a great Kenny Mason feature where he addresses racism in the rock world while still going off. "Sean-Jared" is just a fun song where the duo go flow for flow and the beat progression is just fun to hear. "Closed Caption" is a great breather in the album where the duo reflects on how life can deal a shitty hand with a guitar beat that just build to a chaotic climax in the end. "Panic!!!" is my favorite hype song on this everything is on point. "Full English" is funny asf but I can see how some may view it as annoying, but teezo had another gorgeous feature on it as usual. the last track "we fall" closes the album off amazingly they talk about just being locked in despite getting hated on or missing out on love, the second verse is just phenomenal. I really do love this album go listen 2 it urself fr!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>3) Utopia - Travis Scott</h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/23/Travis_Scott_-_Utopia.png" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	Travis dropped my most anticipated album this year, I was so hyped for it that I even made a blog about ONE album. First of all the rollout was just a blast we had a movie, the briefcases, and the hidden features initially just made me so hyped. When the album dropped I was in my car with 2 homies, shit was bumpin' fr. On first listen i thought rob49 was YB and i started getting soo turnt i shook the whip hahahha. sadly it wasn't YB but Rob49 killed that verse. the album is just filled with so many hype moments "Fein" "meltdown" hyaena" and "Topiatwins" have probably become house party anthems by now. this project combines Travis's darker aesthetics from the rodeo era with the pure hype of the Astroworld era. I really think it's his best album.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>2) Burning Desire - MIKE</h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8b/Mike_-_Burning_Desire.png" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	MIKE has been great for a while, but this album deserves to be in a museum. MIKE produces and raps his ass off on this, so many tracks to talk about but I'll keep it brief. "African Sex Fantasy" is one of my favorite beats this year, just so hard and it got that little dog woofing its dope man. "Snake Charm" oh my god its smooth but so sad MIKES lazy delivery works well with it he said, "it means the most when you hit me it show i exist". I had to pause the song when I heard that, because I legit got goosebumps, hope he is doing well real talk. "Set the Mood" is just so smooth MIKES ears for samples is undefeated I swear. "Mussel Beach" is my favorite MIKE verse ever he just eats its up and leaves no crumbs. There is so many other songs I fw off this project but I don't have that type of time to write it all, just listen for yourself and see!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>1) A GREAT CHAOS - KEN CARSON</h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f5/Ken_Carson_-_A_Great_Chaos.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="blog">	I just really love this album, when I was talking about aesthetics matching music earlier, this is the prime example of that. Ken delivered big time, I genuinely love every song on this album. The crazy thing is I didn't care about it dropping at all, my homeboy told me about it the night it came out, and my apartment power went out so I said fuck it let me drive around. 3 albums dropped that night, Burning Desire, Then You Pray for Me, and AGC. As you can imagine it was a really good car ride... I love this album so much ill go track for track on it.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="blog">"Green Room" - F1lthy production and Ken Carson just talks his shit I love this opener its both about flexing and feeling lonely, it shows he uses materialism to fill the void.</p>

  <p class="blog">"Lose it" - here is the most chaotic track on the album, and I think its just phenomenal i love the beat so much</p>
  <p class="blog">"Hardcore" - just a banger, he fully embraces the chaos I wanna fight someone to this song</p>
  <p class="blog">"Me N My Kup" - that part in his verse where he changes the flow is so elite the little melodic section is really catchy too</p>

  <p class="blog">"Succubus" - DAMNNN HE FUCKING HATESSS HER FR</p>
  <p class="blog">"Paranoid" - better than Singapore IMO, the beat is just soooo catchy espeically in the end where the synth gets introduced</p>
  <p class="blog">"Pots" - the beat is just really cool, and the melody at the end is fire</p>
  <p class="blog">"Like This" - Uzi had a great verse felt like vintage uzi, they kinda ate it ngl</p>
  <p class="blog">"Overtime" - Ken is ambitious but i really doubt he will become a billionaire </p>
  <p class="blog">"Vampire Hour" - this line alone makes this song a W "I'm a vampire, yeah

    The only time I change is when I turn into a bat
    
    That boy changed, we thought he was real, he turned to a rat"</p>
  <p class="blog">"nightcore 1" - love how the chorus answers the question proposed in the bridge</p>

    <h2>Albums that disappointed me 2k23</h2>


   <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
   <p class="blog">
    2023 was a pretty unusual year for me while I enjoyed many albums from artists I don't usually bump, the artists I do bump just ended up disappointing me. lets not dabble here too long we all know how this goes... </p>

      <h2>1) How do you sleep at night - Teezo Touchdown </h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/6500708300c361fe1f460ef3/1:1/w_3000,h_3000,c_limit/Teezo%20Touchdown-%20How%20Do%20You%20Sleep%20at%20Night" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
     
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="blog">	Now this album isn't bad by any means, its actually average to me, but I feel it is a massive waste of potential. Teezo is an artist that I really started fw this year after seeing him in NYC I became very excited about his debut project. The project dropped in September when I was (surprise surprise) going to NY again so it was a nice full-circle moment for me. The first listen of this project is definitely the best if you are just down for the ride, teezo tackles so many different genres and it is just a blast on first listen, but the flaws started to glare when I realized that, not many of these songs are really songs. a lot of them feel more like ideas especially in the latter half with "Nu Nay" and "I Don't think u c me" even the longer songs are really just combined mini songs, for example, the best and worst track on the album is "Too Easy" on my first listen of the project I kept skipping the song cuz it just gave me a fucking headache, but one day I forgot to skip and a minute 40 later the song completely changed to teezos BEST vocal performance ever. The way tiktok was gassing up his feature on for all the dogs is how they should have gassed this verse cuz it just makes me cry sometimes. I think this is teezos biggest problem, he prioritizes being weird over being good, he can sing like a MF when he wants to and I like weird music like the rest of yall, but when you sacrifice quality just to be different it just leaves me thinking "what if?" </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>2) For all the dogs - drake</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/05/Drake_-_For_All_The_Dogs.png" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
    <p class="blog">	Now this album is just embarrassing, I loved this when it first dropped but like room-temperature milk, it went bad fast. This is bar none Drake's worst project in my opinion. Drake is pushing 40 and getting mad that his 25 year old ex doesn't like him even though he has more money than her new man... it's just kinda sad to see after all these years, drake lost what made him... him. It can be argued that drake was always a womanizing misogynist, and I am not here to play a lawyer but it is undeniable that drake also used to at least be more self-aware. A great example is on the song "Too Good" if it was just drake I would walk away thinking wow he is kinda  douche, but the song is saved from a riri ft showing that drake is aware that maybe he isn't all that. that nuance is lost in his latest project. "her loss" had this same problem too but at least that album is fun and grew on me while for all the dogs makes me more and more sad to be a drake fan. P.S don't get me started on that deluxe soooooo ass! for all the dogs is the first Drake album that I can't play anywhere. Drake has always been a soundtrack artist for me, his albums have always fit a specific thing for me weather it be a season, place or person for example, Honestly nevermind is my go 2 plane album, More Life for the islands, Views in the winter and Take care on a sentimental night. This album doesn't have that effect for me which makes me truly sad especially since he postponed his concert for this stupid album. I will forever be mad about that!</p>

    <h2>3) Cracker Island - Gorillaz</h2>

    margin: 0 auto;">
    <p class="blog">	Just meh, i mean its a solid synth-pop album. i really can't even speak on it too much. the bad bunny song is great though.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>4) Kaytramine - Kaytramine</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b7/Kaytramin%C3%A9_-_Kaytramin%C3%A9.png" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	When this dropped i was ridin it harddd man (pause), but that high only lasted a week. I think the project was a huge fumble by both Amine and Kaytranda. A lot of these beats are just kinda whatever, and Amine should have gone with a more melodic direction like he did on TWOPOINTFIVE. I mean I liked some songs though, forever, sossup, and STFU3 are dope asf, but this album had SUMMER ANTHEM written all over it but just ended up being a passing breeze.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>5) Voir Dire - Earl</h2>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRVtKxB5_4xVxy4mozRcvDqWPR-6CtGP6RjiQ&s" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	We need to have a conversation about the alchemist man. His beats are boring, its the same trick he's been doing for years now (insert meme of the game using the same bar) and I am sick of it. He slows down any rapper he works with, after earls project sick I was excited to see what he would cook up next, especially after a great single plus an immaculate homage to MF DOOM from Atlanta season 4 I had a lot of reasons to be hyped for earl. the album itself is fine though, earls raps are as good as they always are, but these beats man just bore me. the track "Mancala" is my favorite because I love Vince Staples and the beat actually has some energy which is dope. "27 briads" is dope too love that guitar</p>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="blog">	I hate that these albums didn't stick for me, I do fw these artists. the good news is that they don't have to impress me. All of these artists have already made a piece of work that I still love and admire to this day (except teezo but im still rootin for him). What they did this year doesn't change the music they made in the past so I encourage them to explore new sounds rather than try to recapture lighting, it just didn't stick for me personally. If you like these projects then more power to you, I don't even hate these albums outside of the drake one personally. Next blog my official top 10 album list!</p>

  Before I get to my official top 10 list I would like to shout out a few projects that I feel deserve some love and recognition. now let's not ramble too much and jump right into the list!</p>

    <h2>1) fountain baby - Amaarae</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQZ4ZFbRqUSdIv2HrUZrQBbe-7ILjxk6mHQPA&s" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
   
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	6 million monthly listeners is far from underground I know... but I still want to spread the agenda, this album is absolutely fun. The production has a mix of Asian and island influences and her vocal inflections range from hype to sexual. the project feels grandiose the beat on "Wasted Eyes" is one of my favorite things, with its punchy drums and magnificent horns it just feels like a true achievement in music. This year has been rather boring for pop music to me, but I found this release to be refreshing like running through a water fountain.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>2) The 4th Wall - bbygoyard</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-kxuZydFj9QP7No3Z-dHDyEA-t500x500.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Bbygoyard had a busy year this year with 3 whole projects, I think Loreseeker is his best project personally, but 4thwall is an impressive collection of songs. "The 4thwall" is a double album of 4thwall pt1 and 2, part 2 is 10 fold better than part 1, but I wanted to talk about the full package because I feel part 1 needs some recognition despite it lacking the now iconic DJ Smokey taglines that we tend to associate bbygoyard with. The song "New Graphics" is my favorite on side A and has the least amount of streams on the whole album. THIS IS NOT RIGHT, go listen to that song the beat is insane actually and the chorus is catchier than the flu. As for part 2 it has some songs that go crazy as well, "Teacups and kettles", "Slashed Tires" and the now infamous "Vette Sum" go crazy in the car and are just a blast to play. the album is a ton of fun and I recommend it.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>3) Safe Travels - Untiljapan</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQTp4PZ37soHsjcRHQ53ift7SF8xHd0HLRlng&s" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	This guy is the definition of aura, I saw his name and album cover and immediately saw his vision. He is a pretty new artist but he has a great ear for beats and can create a dark mood really well. The project has so many great beats the obvious highlight is the clams casino produced track "kiss n tell" which has this gorgeous vocal sample flip and the chop work at the end just elevates the track to a level reminiscent of old A$AP Rocky. Other tracks are really solid too "Dallas Interlude" is just a vibe in the simplest way possible, the song legit leaves me in a trance. "Roundtripz" and "In the Spur" both are really hard songs the latter has a really dope beat that has these keys that just string the beat together nicely. The last highlight I'd like to share is "Cuban Linx" the Bon Iver sample was very unexpected but the subject matter of the song was actually touching and I was shocked he got so vulnerable on the album. Overall the album is kinda rough in terms of flow but he got hella promise I like him.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>4) Long Light - Lusine</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1023598364_65" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	This is a really solid IDM album, but also a great example of what good mixing can do to elevate a project. I am just in love with the textures of this album, I fell in love with it on a plane ride back in the fall, and has since then been in my rotation for nights where I wear my good headphones. I am a huge fan of the tracks with vocals, I can tell he was going in a more haunting direction, as the vocals on this album strike me more like drones or sirens out in the sea that just captivate me to a rhythm. the title track has to be the highlight for me I am a huge fan of the track build-up because the final 2 minutes of it are just a euphoric rush. to best enjoy a release like this I highly recommend either relaxing, reading, meditating, or studying while listening.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>5) SHITUMSS - Joony</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="https://images.genius.com/22aa1b20577d10ca5aded63e31e81223.1000x1000x1.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Joony is a DMV artist hailing from Maryland the land of good seafood and bad drivers. I find this project to be a blast something about darker atmospheric albums just clicked for me this year I can't lie. the track "OOOOOO" has a really dope beat the melody is murky and the phone ringing in the mix plays a good contrast to keep the tone more energetic. "Keisha" and "Shitumss" both are really hard and have that classic DMV sound. To me, it felt like a throwback to me. The track "Hold Me Down" is also pretty dope Joony taps into his melodic side, it is kinda reminiscent of Nav but I like it. Overall its a solid project I fw Joony.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>6) 2MM DONT JUST STAND THERE - SIDESHOW</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2674439180_65" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Sideshow is a perfect mix of being hard and abstract. His production style is just a treat for the ears with a fun mix of soul samples and trap drums. I saw him live and his energy is just elite. If you like MIKE then you would love sideshow. Songs like "JIH LIKE MORANT" is only a minute long but will show you what he is all about give it a try and tap in!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>7) Higher than Heaven - Ellie Goulding</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/EllieGoulding-HigherThanHeaven-Deluxe-1-1.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 200px; display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Shout out to Ellie Goulding for keeping that 2010's pop alive! While most of her contemporaries of her era ventured off into different sounds, Lady Gaga making albums with Tony Bennet, Miley Cyrus making ballads, and Britaney doing spins in her mansion, Ellie chose to stay the same and improve the formula. This album takes all the aspects I love about 2010's pop and just improves upon them. the beats are so fun and danceable, it's a shame Pop went to a more slow and drab scene. I miss music I could dance to and she got it! "like a savior" "By the end of the night" and "Let it die" have great beats and her vocal range is actually really impressive, she is an amazing singer.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	This year was hard for me to recommend albums without talking about my top 10, in all honesty, a lot of albums disappointed me this year, but that is a blog for another day. I still highly recommend these albums and at one point they were in my official top 10 list so i can assure their quality!</p>

"I understand why you did it ya know, I too wish I could turn my brain off and forget the world, but baby you have people who care about you, people who you spent years building relationships with are you really going to throw all that away just because you're in a mood". Danny would groan but say no more, for what he lacked in language he made up for in tone. "I see, I'll give you your space tonight, but we need to make a decision soon we can still fix it ya know," she spoke as she walked to the bedroom. The night would end like all nights do for Danny, with shitty cable TV and cheap liquor. This is a cycle that has been consuming him for 3 months now since the surgery.

    <p class="blog">	The year is 2297, the world is run by robots powered by AI and the effects of the AI are not nearly as bad as the ancestors would have thought. I mean sure there was record-high unemployment for nearly 250 years, but in the last 47 years we turned it into a lazy man's paradise. The economy is based around the haves and the have-nots. Those who have a job and those who "have not" a brain. The government realized the human brain is the ultimate supercomputer and it is being wasted on lesser lifeforms when it could be used to power an AI robot 100x more efficiently. So they launched a program where you could lease your brain and get a monthly royalty check. As long as your brain is in a machine then you will get a portion of its earnings. A month of the work a robot can do covers a lifetime of work for the average man. As of late the operation has become rather trendy, if you can get more money doing less then a man without a brain is smarter than one with one... Would ya say so?</p>

<p class="blog">	4:37 PM, Danny was awakened from the fortress of his couch by the sound of silence. He veered to the corner of the room to see his wife, Francesca eyeing him with the remote in hand. "I was watching that you knowwww" he uttered his first  sentence in what felt like years. She took a deep sigh, "do you know what day it is today?" she muttered in a shakey tone. His eyes began to glow like a dusty projector being used after years of collecting dust. What felt like a wave of hope began to fill her soul as he thought. For a second the anticipation felt as sweet as the euphoria of winning, but you can never count your eggs too early as he would ultimately mutter "Dr.Who Marathon". The heights she felt would ultimately be the heights she fell from as the hope that once filled her soul turned to resentment. She had realized the man she knew was far gone. She would leave that day after writing a note on the side of the bed he had yet to sleep in. </p>

<p class="blog">	The life of the Salmon is the life of wisdom. The salmon sees the wonders of the ocean and fears it. They enjoy its treasures and beauty but realize its dangers are far more severe for their young. they make the sacrifice to go back to where they come from to ensure the safety of their offspring. The journey is filled with many obstacles from humans, and bears but the most fierce of all is the flow of water. Water like time only moves one way, the fish can't change that fact but chooses to push forward anyway with the resilience and determination to secure the next generation. Their legacy lives with their struggle and their sacrifice is reciprocated for generations. Salmon are just one in five species to swim upstream. One must wonder who taught them that and what the salmon see in the ocean to realize they need to come back despite their other brethren settling in the salt. To go upstream isn't to go backwards, the treasures of this world can control you as much as they allure you.</p>

Tears started to roll down her face like waterfalls, and thoughts of conforming began to fill her mind. What’s the point of swimming upstream if everything I do is unseen? What is the point of being different if nobody cares? Why did I choose this life if it would end up in isolation? She dug into her purse and found an old business card, she started shaking at the realization of what she thought crawled through her spine. “it’s time, one can’t be free if everyone else is in prison.” she nodded and reached for the phone.</p>

<p class="blog">Years passed and like sand in the wind, it all changed. society ultimately collapsed and the world became a jungle of rust and debris. The AI robots eventually saw no need for humans which caused another unemployment high of 100%, which ended in a total bankruptcy of the government, causing the brainless to go broke along with the unemployed. those with a brain tried to revolt but it ultimately led to total annihilation, as within a day we saw nuclear warfare. Nobody survived. The world is a desert of radiation and regret. centuries down the line a truly greater life form would explore a very familiar apartment as they read a burnt note that read “Happy birthday…” The rest of the note was lost due to the war, but the proof of intelligence still stood. in the end, you did exist.</p>

 <p class="blog">	"Well, Mr. Ghostface I'm glad ya asked, scary movies have been a bit of an infatuation for me as of late and this October was filled with a few watches of some old classics as well as some fresh blood in the world of horror. If you don't mind I would like to talk about the medium as a whole I hope it's not too late for a Halloween special. My love for the genre is actually rather newfound, I actually used to really hate horror movies, and for a good reason too. That reason is that I was a literal CHILD and I was scared. As a kid, I would only watch comedies, but whenever I would get a glimpse of the taboo known as horror I would always be filled with regret. Just like the cat, I too was killed by my own curiosity every so often I would find myself peaking clips or watching scenes on YouTube or behind the couch as my dad would idly watch some C-list horror movie edited down to fit a cable airing. Things like "Final Destination" and "The Ring" really scared me as a child, and I know this isn't technically a horror movie, but "The Good Son" also scared me so bad as a kid that I would end up praying like 8 times in a row that my mom would not throw me off a cliff. (*writer note, my mom is a good person and wouldn't throw me off a cliff), but it was the ideas that these films presented to my young mind that generated such fear. the idea that anything can go wrong at any given moment, or that your own family will let you go are real fears that people have and these films portray them, well I would say they portray them well, but on rewatch I have come to a conclusion that most of these films don't portray them good at all. What scared me as a child just bores me as an adult, (The Good Son is still a good movie, but it's not scary anymore), I have come to realize that when it comes to horror films I was born in the wrong generation.

    <p class="blog">	Now I know that is an oldhead ass saying, but if you walk with me right quick I will run you down the highs and lows of this beautiful and twisted genre known as horror. From its origins to its new modern incarnation, I would like to highlight a few films and features of each era today.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Starting off with the birth of horror, the early 1900s focused on religious imagery to garner fear, but I personally doubt fear was what they were trying to achieve with these films. Films like "The Infernal Cauldron" and "The Devil's Castle" utilized slight of hand and primitive camera techniques to create illusions and surprise audiences. While these films are impressive for their time, a modern audience would not even budge let alone move at the peaks of these horrors. What they lacked in fear they more than made up for in creativity and ambition these films were the pioneers of the genre we love today.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Our next iteration of horror will come from an old literature influence. The rise of the classic monster pictures such as Frankenstein and Dracula, is thanks to movies evolving to being longer and having audio. This was huge for the genre of horror because sound design can really make or break the atmosphere of a film for me. Dracula 1931 still is impressive to me, I find the portrayal of the iconic vampire to still be the blueprint today with the way he dressed, the way his mansion was designed, and of course his iconic accent. I was just a big fan of this era, but these films did not scare me not even an inch. This is more so just a testament to how iconic these characters have become though, I mean it is hard to be scared of characters that appear on seasonal cereal boxes or characters that were played by Adam Sandler. The horror impact these films have may have lost its grip due to society no longer fearing these monsters, but the films of that era are still a treat in my opinion.</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	The 50's and 60's led to a rise in alien and zombie films, perhaps due to a post-nuclear world, we channeled our fears into the extra terrestrial or the idea of a zombie apocalypse. I'm not sure I don't really care for zombies, but in Japan, they dropped Godzilla which was definitely fueled by the ghosts of the war. what is now a sensationalized mascot for Japan was once an eerie tale of the reproductions of nuclear war. Nuclear war is still very real and has been used as a plot device many times before, but in terms of fear, it is rather low for me... so on to the next era, please.
</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	This is where we finally arrive at the classic era of horror that we know today. The rise of the slasher thanks to the original "Halloween" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". These films birthed a new era of staples and tropes that we would see in horror movies for the next century. the appeal of these slasher films was that they weren't *too* supernatural, it felt like you could be a victim to the killer, and this created real fear. but the fear was only a byproduct of the real appeal of slashers and that is the thrill, slashers made murdering people exciting. It may be a taboo, but deep down everybody wanted to see how many fucked up ways somebody could get killed. Another appeal of these films is the new rise in sex appeal, I find the trope to be beyond tired now but people like a good set of tits when it comes to their slasher movies. Outside of slashers we also got a taste of other classics like Alien and Jaws which appeal to our more primal fear. a fear of the wild, it's our nature to want to feel superior to other species so seeing a killer alien or unstoppable great white shark, made many audiences feel rather unsafe and eerie. While I like Jaws and think it's a good movie, I have to condemn it for the negative reproductions it created on not just cinema but the environment as a whole. It's absurd to me that fear created from a movie can create such a cruel and uneducated movement such as endangering a whole species.</p>

<br>
<p class="blog">	Movies would only get gorier and gorier as the years went on, Jason and Freddy dominated the 80's with their classic franchises, but we also had some other classics such as "The Shining", "The Poltergeist" and "The Thing". I have yet to see those 3 though, I only wrote them down so I can remind myself to get around to them. Horror was alive and booming in the 80's there were just so many options to choose from and it would only continue as we went into the 90's. the 90's burst the gates when it came to the diversity of films. Films like "Silence of the lambs" "Scream" and "Candyman" are phenomenal and push the genre even further than before.</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	Silence of the Lambs is a cinematic masterpiece filled with suspense, body horror, and twists. it is not only a great horror movie but it is a great movie in general. The horror comes from the fear of the genius and madness of Doctor Hanibal Lecter. Despite him being arguably one of the weaker characters in terms of raw power, I find the sight of him to make me feel so uneasy. Very rarely do you see a character so human seem so monstrous, but he pulls it off perfectly. If you have yet to see this film go give it a watch, the first watch of this movie is one of the best cinematic experiences I have ever had.</p>

<br>
<p class="blog">	Scream is another great film that seeks to parody the (at this point) overdone slasher genre. It does it really well while also ironically enough being a really good slasher. I think the movie is funny and I am a fan of the franchise, scream 6 was really good this year. The climate of the 90's was hot in media due to a rise in censorship, thanks to increasingly violent media. Mortal Kombat had it's blood removed on Nintendo consoles, Beavis couldn't make fires anymore and parents were just looking for ANY REASON other than themselves as to why their kids are acting like assholes. Scream made fun of the notion that violent media creates real-world violence by making a killer inspired by violent movies. it is ridiculous on purpose it challenges the audience to sit and think, "is it reasonable to assume these movies will make me a killer?" the question being rhetorical of course.</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	Candyman is just a sweet movie man (get it cuz candy is sweet). I would write more but I got a schedule to keep soooo on to the fall of horror...</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	The 2000's sucked ass for horror movies IMO films like final destination and paranormal activity just bore me or annoy the fuck out of me. Paranormal Activity specifically created a horrible trend in film due to their marketing campaign, the now infamous "theatre reaction" trailer set a new goal for movie studios and it wasn't to make good films. they now aimed to make the biggest reactions. Horror films became over-glorified amusement park rides filled with cheap scares and too-realistic gore. The "Saw" franchise started in the 2000's and I actually think the movies are solid, but they are rather uncomfortable for even me at times I can't lie.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p class="blog">	Today though I am very optimistic about horror movies in the future. in the mid to late 2010's we saw a more arthouse take on the genre with studio A24 dropping some solid films such as "Pearl" "Hereditary" and "Midsommar" we also got Jordan Peele dropping some phenomenal films like "Nope" "Get Out" and "Us". These films gave horror the respect it deserved in a post-paranormal activity world and I am looking forward to what comes next.</p>

<p class="blog">(this was peak cinema btw)</p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	I love horror, it is the most exciting genre out there, and If I had to pick a favorite scary movie then I would probably go with "The Silence of the Lambs"... hello?... yo you still here??? helloooooo????... Oh, he hung up a while ago..." :(</p>

 <p class="blog">	Hello everyone, I am currently writing this during the first day of my senior year of college. I am currently in between classes, and I have been struck by both inspiration and nostalgia for the summer that has just ensued upon me. Now if you recall at the beginning of summer, I made a blog post about why I am excited about the summer and what I want to do. heading into the summer I was mostly excited about, Bonnaroo, California, and just spending time at home doing normal things like museums and concerts. I am happy to report that I did and enjoyed all of that and then some more!

    <p class="blog">Let's start in chronological order, the first thing I did was watch Paprika and shin kamen rider within the same week. These two films were really good Paprika specifically and I am so glad I finally got around to watching it. the group of friends I saw it with are dope and I found myself spending a lot of time with them this summer. Paprika was a generational movie, it is like an anime version of Inception but the overall themes and message are very endearing and I shed a tear watching it. Shin Kamen Rider was a dope action film and I am a fan of the shin series, having been recently put on to it thanks to Shin Ultraman, if you are a fan of that classic era of Japanese cinema then these shin movies will satisfy you for sure. they are both cheesy and badass at the same time.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">	The next thing I did was go to new york for the Tisakorean show. This trip impacted me way more than I expected, I came back home a fan of both the city of new york and Tisakorean. I already made a blog about tisa before so I will talk about the other aspects of that trip that changed me. My friends and I met Teezotouchdown at the park and he played some unreleased music. That encounter with Teezo, definitely made me become a bigger fan of him. He just looks so cool and I felt he had a nice soul. He is quiet in person I think he is shy. Another thing that was lit in New York was the food, we ate good every day there. There is a fire ass bakery in the train station that genuinely made me think about dropping my diet. I had a key lime pie that was to die for, but my boy said the banana pudding is divine. The library in NYC is a great hangout spot as well I would real life just chill there and read because I was so tired after that early morning train ride. Overall NYC opened me up to the power of short trips, I will be visiting new york a lot, I love it there and it can easily work with my schedule as just a weekend thing. The New York trip reminded me that I wasn't trapped.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">	After NYC, my next major move would be a month later @ Bonaroo. Bonaroo is basically a hippie Coachella, ngl I was nervous about it. Camping, Hydrating, and all the people seemed kinda stressful to me, but once my homeboy and I set up camp, I felt a sense of joy. before there were shows I was just enjoying the atmosphere of Bonaroo so much, we would literally just go running around and finding new people based on how cool their tents were. Thanks to that strategy we were able to meet new friends and have a group to roll with when we hit shows, which can be very helpful in dealing with big crowds of people. Everything at the festival was amazing, but the main reason I was there was definitely for the artists, and sheesh they did not disappoint. I was able to see, foo fighters, korn, 070 Shake, Baby Keem, Kendrick Lamar, Lil Nas x, Paramore, and so many other great artists. the hardest part about Roo for me was leaving (literally the traffic was insane and it was raining like hell). Overall Roo reminded me that I am young and I love having fun, I genuinely was starting to feel like an old head but that roo energy hit me hard.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Now literally a day after I got back home from Bonnaro. I had my next move, it was a performance for my friend Sam's album release party. I still had my voice partially gone but the energy and musical itch I had post roo gave me plenty of motivation to thug it out. the performance is on youtube, and Sam's album is on streaming everywhere please be sure to support Sam for I am honored that he put me on his show.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">I was so tired after all that music though, I decided to lay low for a bit, just work and relax more. I went to Vegas and New York again in July for a BJJ tournament and a small music festival. I was so tired though but I still really enjoyed them. new york part 2 was funny because we went to the club after the music festival, and I ordered Monfungo and ate it right next to the dance floor. At the end of July, I would go to California for my family. I love going to California because I feel loved over there, it has always felt like a home to me, and coming back as an adult is even more interesting. it's a confusing dichotomy because my grandparents still treat me like a baby while my aunts and uncle treat me like a grown ass man. I love it though, I still let my grandma feed me if she wants to fr. My uncle got like 4 kids who are like baby-age. They are really sweet and I loved seeing them and trying to keep them entertained. Overall Cali was a great contrast to the high-action things I had been doing. I was able to take a step back and be with my family which was needed.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">To end my summer I saw Beyonce live at FedEx field. As a performer, Beyonce is without a doubt one of the greatest to ever do it. I was flabbergasted at her vocal ability and even though I was at the top row in the rain I felt a true bliss just being able to see and hear what can be argued as musical perfection. On the last day of summer, I went to the fair to officially close the book on my summer vacation. it was a little corny, but in a cute way I rode the Ferris wheel as the fair closed, it was symbolic of me looking at my summer ending from the height  I was standing at. From that height I can say I 100% enjoyed the view, my summer has been everything I hoped and then some. In addition to what I mentioned earlier I have also been doing BJJ, and just reading as well. This summer made me enjoy so much in my life and I am currently in a really happy headspace. Thank you to my people who made this summer memorable for me. this really was my best summer ever. </p>

  <h2>Utopia: first impressions</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">	Well the day has finally come, Travis Scott has finally dropped Utopia and with the wait came huge expectations from not only me but the rap fanbase as a whole, did he deliver? In my opinion, HE 100% DID and right now I would like to share a few moments and things that really stood out to me. This isn't a review or a deep dive, I just want to share my initial thoughts.

<div class="container"
    style="display:none;">
<!--Insert the rest of your blog's text here!-->
    <p class="blog">	In the very beginning of the album being announced I was not excited at all, I was convinced Travis Scott grew off me. I always associated his music with my cringe ass high school years. Travis did something I didn't expect though, as we got closer to the album dropping he actually made me get hyped, this is one of the best album rollouts since the Kanye donda 1 era. So when that album dropped best believe I was hyped as hell. I got in my car with some homies and loitered in a backroad and let the music run its course.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	As for the music itself, I was genuinely blown away by the production and variation. The album takes a more mellow and ambient approach to production for some songs and I feel these tracks play for a great contrast to the more hype rager songs I associate travis with. The first song sets the pace so fucking well, its exciting but dark, it evokes both excitement and curiosity. Modern Jam has a feature from the GOAT teezo touchdown and is produced by 1/2 of daft punk, i just think that's neat the song is easily a highlight for me. My Eyes is another track I really enjoyed, I thought frank ocean was on it for a second when I first spun it, The first half being this cold, slow and ambient like beat serves as a great breather for the beautiful transition into a more hyped up second half. Drake was on the album that song "meltdown" was really good too. Fein was a good song, a younger me would have loved it more, im kind of over carti, but pairing him up with sheck wes and carti doing a new cadence was a great move and made the song hype. That Beyoncé track sounds like a renaissance B-side, which I was all here for. I Know? is probably the catchiest song on my first listen and is one of my favs. I thought YB was on topia twins but it was just Rob49.... :( still a good song. Parasail a great breather track because the next track skitzo is just 6 minutes of hype, we had a good young thug feature and a nice beat switch. Lost forever is really really good one of the first utopia era songs to be shared around, but the album release version has a new beat during westside gunn's part which elevates the song to an upper echelon. looove is good love the dance beat but could do without the cudi verse, i hate when he does that cadence where he sounds like a bored cicada. K-Pop is a good song but it definitly feels out of place, bad bunny is still the goat though and ate it up. Telekenisis is INSANEEE future cant do any wrong and SZA at the end put this in my top 3 fosho. the last song was a good outro James Blake is a safe beat for a feature and the 21 verse was solid.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">My overall thoughts on the album, I think its really fun and has potential to be my favorite Travis album, it embraces the darker sounds like rodeo but has the stacked hyped moments like astroworld. Sometimes though I feel travis gets outshined on some of the songs, even on a production standpoint while I liked the beats, I can definitely say they felt like they were made for the featured artists in mind more than travis. Even on some of the solo travis songs like gods country and thank god, it sounds more like a kanye song (well some of the songs are actually old kanye scraps so that makes sense). Travis is good though and does show his versatility on this album really well, I think it will take me more listens to point him out better. </p>

  <h2>Tisakorean an Ode to Silliness</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">Tisakorean is an artist that I was put on to rather recently. Back in May, I went to New York for his concert because my friends invited me. Before the concert, I only knew a few of his songs and thought nothing of him. I viewed the concert as an opportunity to travel and get drunk with some friends so naturally I accepted. The concert though was more than I could have imagined it opened with a great set by Dazegxd which was elite off-rip, then when Tisa came on stage I felt a new energy take me. Usually at concerts im either lit, sad, raging, or dancing. At Tisa though I was just #SILLY :P everyone at the venue was wearing a silly outfit tisa included, he even wore a hot dog costume mid-show and his hype man had an ice spice munch shirt on as well.

  <p class="blog">That munch shirt sooo fye doe!!</p>
   
    <br>
    <br>
  
    <p class="blog">	Anyways back to the story, the vibes were just silly every song he performed really felt like a joke. not a bad joke, a really good joke I had a lot of fun I was enjoying the music on an ironic "soulja boy swag" level of understanding. I think that's where most people see Tisa. Towards the end of his set though he performed one song that really changed my mind on him as an artist...</p>
    <br>
    <img src="/images/backseatplays.png" style="width: 90%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	This fucking song bruh.... Backseat in my opinion is Tisa's magnum opus. it's not just his best song... it is THE BEST SONG EVER. I knew this was a song from don toliver album earlier (spoiler alert go down is my favorite song off Don's album too). Hearing Backseat Live changed me though. This song is both silly and romantic, I feel warm listening to this song. The production and vocal effects are alien even for the average tisa song. Even Tisa knows how special this song is and during the show he had the whole crowd wave their hands around and sing along. This song from that moment had a hold on me and made me realize that tisakorean is more than just a silly dude, he is in fact one of the best artists of our generation.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Speaking of silly dude, I'd like to talk about the next song Sillydude. This song right here is special man, Tisa once again makes a more low-key song. this one is melancholic despite the silly name. This song is about Tisa talking to this girl who says she acts silly, tisa responds by saying that he is silly too, and that he is a silly dude. Now the actual dialogue is simple and not what I'm analyzing. the part I find interesting is the meaning of silly in this song. Silly is said in a more demeaning way, especially when you compare it to his iconic (SILLY!) adlib. I feel this song was about how people look down on silly people, that they discount them and can't take them seriously because they are simply too silly. In the last verse, Tisa said he needs a silly hoe to teach him everything she knows. To Tisa being silly isn't being stupid, being silly is simply a way of life.</p>
<br>
<p class="blog"><i><b>Part II. Embrace the silly :3</b></i></p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	SILLY SILLY SILLY SILLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you gotta be a silly hoe. the philosophy of tisakorean and his music is that it is fun > perfect. his albums and songs are all about moments you can't just play his album front 2 back in ur bedroom alone you need to be in a silly mood to have fun. the two songs I mentioned earlier are probably his few exceptions to my rule because I can spin those songs alone all the time (believe me I DID HAHAHA). We enjoy music the same way we enjoy the beach on a summer day. There are albums that are critically acclaimed and viewed as a perfect piece of work, this is akin to people metal detecting for gold by the shore. Sure there is a lot of work in understanding some of these harder albums but the payoff is well worth it. Artists like Drake are the beach volleyball of music, it's fun and accessible and everyone can get into it. Lastly, we have Tisa's music he makes the music for the silly hoes who play around in the water or build sand boobs on top of their homies. It's childish, it's silly but it's both oddly nostalgic and really fun. Once in a while enjoy the water, my friends, it's a hot summer after all :P</p>

  <h2>Summer 2k23 (the finale)</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">Despite the shitty weather and my new office job, I can't help but feel the overwhelming joys of summer vacation upon myself right now. I came into this summer with the mindset that it is my last real summer since I am graduating next spring I will no longer be on the same time as a student. Personally, I am really excited about that, because despite my current joy right now, I actually hate summer it is easily my least favorite season and I yearn for the days when I can just work and take my days off in the middle of October instead of a hot and busy 3-month timespan of being around loud, sweaty and smelly people. These flights are too damn expensive and these tourists just kill my vibe personally, even my own city aint safe considering I live next to the nation's capital and all that. Despite me hating this time of year though, I do have a specific fondness for this specific summer. Something about it being my "last summer" is just dramatic enough for me to give a fuck I guess.

    <p class="blog">	So how will I make my summer hit different? Right now am trying to maximize spending more time with the people around me and doing more local activities that I love in the DMV. Things like museums, libraries, concerts, and sports are all things I really would love to do this summer, hell I would even enjoy just chilling with a homie and watching TV. I really don't have the dreams of grandeur that I once had as of right now I only got 1 vacation planned and that is Bonaroo, and personally I am okay with that (but mom i know u read my blogs, I AM LYING ON THIS SENTANCE pleaseeee i wanna go to cali again cuz i miss the fam). okay soooo I really want 2 vacations, but a family trip doesn't count sooo IDC go debate a wall. Back to the main point, for the summer I am really just contempt with chilling and doing the same activities that drove me mad in summer's past.  maybe I am changing as a person but a lot of things don't excite me like they used to anymore and with everything I lost interest in I gained an appreciation for new things. Just this week I learned that I really love helping kids, I signed up to do some volunteer work this summer because it seems like something I would genuinely enjoy. Another thing I am finding interest in is museums. I am so blessed to live in the DMV area due to the treasure trove of information that lies behind each of our grand Smithsonian, but really I just like to go there and joke around it's not like I'm a nerd of something hahahahha. Another thing I love now is Brazillian Juijitsu, one of my co-workers invited me to train in his gym and I am having such a ball with it so far. it is a great martial art due to the combination of thinking and physical skill it is a true workout for the mind and body and I am absolutely IN LOVE with it. 

    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Other things I am doing this summer is watching more movies and doing some short day trips. after finding out I can travel to NY for only 40 dollars round trip via train, it gave me a lot of ideas and I know once I get paid I will take a day trip over the weekend and blow a check on some dumb shit. The movies this summer will be really good too, I am very hyped for the Barbie movie, spider-verse, Asteroid City, Haunted Mansion, and so much more. Next week I am doing back-to-back movie nights with Paprika, and shin kamen rider. I am super excited to watch all of these films this summer and since I got a job best believe imma buy them blue icee's too IDGAF if it's a scam or it makes my tongue look like an ed edd n eddy character. </p>
   
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">My summer will end dope too with Drake and Beyonce in the same week those concerts will be legendary I tell you, legendary! Overall I am highly optimistic and excited to end this summer saga and eventually end this college life in general... but that's a blog post for another day ^~*</p>

  <h2>Unusual Nostalgia</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">
  Nostalgia is the momentum that makes the pendulum of life swing from the past to the present. The fact that we are able mentally transfer ourselves into our own past, to experience some of the sweeter things in life is a feeling that has always been both endearing and tragic to me. In today's society, I feel that we tend to manufacture false nostalgia, which can lead to an unhealthy cycle of reminiscing on the past whilst being bitter about the future. This mindset has turned some of the most optimistic and ambitious people I know into shells of themselves with their only wish to go back in time.

    <p class="blog">Manufactured nostalgia is one thing that has started to irk me more as I’ve grown older. As an #official twenty-something-year-old, I can tell you that there is an increase in “2000’s babies” nostalgia on the internet and in my day-to-day conversations. From my Twitter timeline being full of Spongebob clips, to people trying to gas up those terrible Debby cakes we used to eat as kids. It has gotten sooooo bad these days that even things like the school light fixtures can make people nostalgic. In my opinion, though these things are nothing more than shallow memories that don’t really have much nostalgia because it was just things that were forced upon you. Everyone knows these things and grew up with them, so what makes them special to you? For something to be truly nostalgic, you need a strong emotional connection not just a shallow “Oh yea I remember this as a kid” answer. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Today I want to talk about unusual nostalgia, and why it's different than the oversaturated Twitter bait nostalgia we see in our day-to-day lives. First of all, what is unusual nostalgia? Well since it is a term I made up, I figure I am the most qualified to tell yall, it is a specific thing from your past that only you (or a small population) feel nostalgic for. Seems pretty simple right? But in my opinion, it is its exclusivity that makes it infinitely more meaningful.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	As humans we are designed to find comfort in conformity, we want to feel we fit in with the people around us. This is why so many people find comfort and nostalgia in even the most mundane things of the past. The only true connection they have to it is that everyone else shares that connection. While I do value a shared experience in life, I find this form of nostalgia to ultimately be damaging because it can tend to alienate your present self from society. It is a mindset that allows you to adopt a “life was better back than” mindset. Picture this when we are in our 70s and retired are we going to talk about our office cubicles like how we talk about our high school desks? The answer should hopefully be no, because that would be really sad if we was nostalgic over that. I think school and childhood nostalgia is really easy to make for most people because, for a lot of people, it was a time when they felt the most social due to them not having to try as hard to make friends back then. This type of nostalgia is the junk food of memories it lacks effort and only fulfills you through the most artificial means possible.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQLbdYuTKtARHJBewkwnPQUD5aCk_PvOtHFMw&s" style="width: 90%;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
   
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	For me, the type of nostalgia I value is far more unusual. The nostalgia doesn’t only take me back to my past but also helps build me up to be the man I am today. The personal experiences I hold dear that have changed me are what make up most of my nostalgia. I don’t hold high school in high regard, but I am forever grateful and nostalgic for the football team, and some of my teachers specifically my Spanish teacher Mr.Gale and my government teacher Mr.Busch. These people have given me memories and opportunities to grow and while I don’t look back at my time in high school as something I want to experience again, I find comfort in the fact that I can take a pleasant look at my past and come out with a brighter outlook on my future.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	To get into even more obscure and weird nostalgia though, I will have to go even further back in my life to my childhood. This in my opinion is where I find my true nostalgia. There are three things that make me feel the most nostalgic, the PlayStation 2 startup sound, yellow bricks, and two albums, the first album being “the colour and the Shape” by the foo fighters and the other being a George Michael compilation album. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">The PS2 was a staple in my family quite literally we would spend nights playing Madden or mortal kombat. I was just a little kid so I sucked at both games but I would always remember hearing that sharp start-up sound. It was a sound that was both frightening and enticing, as a child a lot of things seem more scary than what they actually are and nothing encapsulated my childhood fear like that sound. The irony with the fear is that it was all irrational, behind that seemingly traumatizing sound lay some of my favorite gaming memories ever. That sound and that experience shaped me in my future, I don’t really get scared rather I get excited more often. A lot of things that can scare you, can also be challenges and opportunities to do new things. That is one of the main reasons why I’m not a nervous or shy person when it comes to new experiences. </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p class="blog">Yellow bricks are weird, but growing up both my parents would work so I would spend a lot of my early years at my grandma's house. She lived in this small little yellow brick house in a culdesac. Her house was like something I have never seen before it kinda reminded me of something you would build out of Legos. In a time when I didn’t know addresses or even how to read I found it importance of those yellow bricks to be paramount in my knowing where I was at. The idea that she lived in a place that felt like a landmark to me made me feel safe, even when I was away from my mom and dad. I was a clingy baby (big-time mama’s boy) so me being away woulda scared me, but something about my grandma and her yellow brick home always felt comforting to me. My grandma was dope and we would spend our time together watching cartoons, laughing, and eating. She would spoil the fuck out of me, I can’t even lie, I knew she was real when she would watch Ed Edd n Eddy with me, because my parents used to think a lot of my favorite shows were gross and weird so sharing that with her felt really nice. Every time I see yellow bricks I think of my grandma and I feel comforted, no matter where I go I can always find a home within my heart.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">Lastly are the two albums, now if you are an avid or even casual reader of my blogs, then you should know by now that I really love music, but alas that was not always the case. Growing up I was indifferent to music the only things I heard were whatever was on the radio, my mom's Arabic music, and my dad's music. Now both my parents have implanted their music taste in me over time but I will say, as of late I have started to feel nostalgic and more connected with my dad's music. My dad's music taste is based a lot on the ’80s and 90’s music, growing up I heard a lot of A-HA, Foo Fighters, George Michael, Phil Collins, Prince, Michael Jackson, and of course the various random one-hit wonder bands of that era as well that I just can’t seem to name right now. Now I like all the artists I mentioned above, but the two that make me feel nostalgic would have to be Foo Fighters and George Michael. Foo Fighters is responsible for making my favorite rock album of all time, this is due to my dad playing songs like “My Hero” and “Everlong” all the time back in the day. It was the first time I had ever seen my father dissect the meaning and lyrics of a song and try to tell me something about it. Seeing him become passionate about a song was something I was annoyed by as a child, but as I grew into my own being I find that passion to mean a lot, especially coming from my dad who isn’t as into music as I am. It really felt like a full circle moment when the feelings my dad had for the music became the feelings I have for the music, and it makes me nostalgic for the days he would play that album in his pickup truck. The second album is George Michael’s “Ladies and Gentleman… the best of George Michael”. This album was just a compilation of some of his biggest hits. We had this one on CD and as a kid, I had no idea half the songs on here were about sex, but I really loved the music. This was the album we would pop in the car and drive around on a sunny day with no destination. Hearing songs like “Don't Let the sun come down on Me” as you are cruising in the back seat as the sunsets on the most scenic road you have ever laid your eyes on. It was a moment that felt straight out of a movie for me. What makes George Michael’s music special to me is that it is dramatic enough to make a moment special without taking you out of the moment. He has songs that I would argue are objectively perfect or at least perfect for specific moments. This CD made me appreciate music the same way I appreciate wine today, it is something that only elevates life. Overall I think the nostalgia for my dad’s music taste ultimately lies in the fact I am getting older and I have my own taste now, but whenever I overlap with my father in songs it always feels special to me. We are two drastically different people but even we can find some common ground and I truly think that is fantastic.</p>

  <p class="blog">Nostalgia is a great feeling, I view it like an elegant dish rather than a tube of fast food that is constantly being fed to us. The feeling of nostalgia has to come up naturally through our own brain recognition, not just through some internet post trying to force positive memories to keep you complacent in life. Nostalgia is a feeling that should make you thankful for the journey because it brought you to where you are now, not because you want to drive back. The truth of the matter is for most of us are still young and can achieve many more memories that can fuel our future nostalgia, so let’s keep driving </p>

  <p class="blog">	Thank you for reading this blog post, Summer is officially here for me, and I am going to be very ambitious this summer. I have a few trips already planned out and I want to hang out with a lot of people this summer and make some new memories, If you want to hang out please reach out to me sometimes I need a reason to be motivated, as is the curse of being an introvert. Overall I am doing good on my 2023 goals though, my gym process is going great, I need to pick up drawing again, but music and writing are going smooth too I got some nice things planned stay tuned!</p>

  <h2>YOU ARE LISTENING TO MUSIC WRONG</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">	Hello everyone, sorry for the lack of posts I have been superrrrrr busy hahahahha but I am back #yipeee. During my little hiatus, I have been feeling a heavy amount of numbness and a lack of inspiration. As of late it feels like all my passions have been on the decline, I have been drawing less, writing less, and making music less. My lack of production on the things I love only added to my lack of inspiration which in turn only made it harder for me to get back into them. But after a well-deserved spring break, I am feeling recharged and excited to do things again. One of the things that made me find a new stride in my life is music, now anyone who knows me personally knows I love me some music. But before spring break I just found myself not even enjoying some of my favorite artists like I used to. After the Rihanna halftime show, I thought for sure I would stream all her music but I barely even felt the itch to touch her discog. Even Aubrey (drake) Grahm was someone I felt sick of, and I know that sentence made a lot of you drake #haters happy, but I got some news for yall now! I love music again (including drake ahahhahaha). So what changed in my life to make me enjoy these things again? Well, I personally believe there are 3 factors that affect your feeling about a song outside of the song itself.</p>
     
   <center> <input onclick="change16()" value="Show More" ID="button16" type="submit" class="collapse16" style="cursor: url(custompointer.png), auto; position:relative; top:50%; margin: 0 auto; display:inline-block; width:30vw;height:30px;color:white; background-color:black;"/>
 

<div class="container"
    style="display:none;">
<!--Insert the rest of your blog's text here!-->
    <p class="blog">	The first factor is the scenery. Music is meant to be the soundtrack to our own lives and if our movies take place in the same 3 sets then we are bound to feel that our score is out of place. I love future but his music simply doesn't hit the same when I am on my college campus, or when I am listening to Call me if you get lost in the cold ass streets of Richmond I am bound to feel a disconnect to the music. Just like a movie score, our songs should enhance the places we are at instead of taking us away from them. For me personally, a change of scenery was necessary since 2023 started I have rarely been outside, but as soon as I went outside I found that a change of scenery enhanced my music listening so much. I was bumping that new kali uchis album on the beach and it was so gorgeous I genuinely felt like I was in heaven. You don't have to travel too far though to change your scenery though. Sometimes all you need is a nighttime drive, or a walk through the park to find a new appreciation for not just the music but life itself. One of my favorite things to do is go to the art museum and play Aphex Twin, it just enhances my experience so much more. Or when I cook I like to play bossa nova. So to conclude I feel a change of scenery can enhance your life and music so much more.</p>

  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;">
   
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	The next factor is movement, whether you are driving, fucking, or dancing you are still moving. Music in its base factor is built on rhythms and beats (even taylor swift, unfortunately) and our society has become more and more sedentary as time and technology have progressed. I want you to dance IDC if you are bad at it, just bust a move and you will not only hear the music, but you will also feel it. Usually, when new music drops it is midnight on a Thursday night and I am in my room. of course, I can't just start dancing around like a lunatic my neighbors are trying to sleep. So now usually on the first listens I try to head bump or do some little hand movements just as a way to feel the rhythm more, but for some albums, I can't fully get a grasp on them until I can actually fully move and dance. Drakes honestly nevermind is a great example of this. The amount of love I have for this album is genuinely stupid, but it dropped in the summer and I was literally traveling when the album dropped. My first listen I was in a hotel room rocking getting hyped in my bed. The next day though that is when the album had a new level for me, as I was going home from the airport I had songs like "flights booked", "Sticky" and "Jimmy Cooks" on repeat. and I started to feel the album on a personal level. Seeing the wings of a plane while drake sings in the most hypnotic way possible on flights booked is a memory I will forever hold when it comes to travel and now I do it every time I am on a plane. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	The last factor is mindset. In the era of social media and short attention spans it feels so important to be able to stay on the most current event. In turn, though this has destroyed a lot of enjoyment in media. I had a script for a video I scrapped about the problem with oversaturation, but basically one of the points I made was how we value the power of holding a first take. How we want to set a trend of opinions. When Lil Yachty dropped his album this year everyone on Twitter was singing its praises saying how generational he is as an artist, but now nobody is talking about the album anymore. The music discourse on social media has become a cycle of chewing and spitting when really music is a meal. We are allowed to have first impressions but when you take a first impression as the fact you may fail to see what lies beyond your initial perception of the art. On the other side of things, we have the dangers of over-dissecting music. I notice this problem more so with me and my friends who make music, a musician's ear, and mind are far pickier on things than the average fan (not to sound snobby of course). This pickiness is important to have especially when it comes to elevating your own craft, I wouldn't trust a chef whose favorite restaurant is McDonald's, but on the flip side, this criticalness can lead to a loss of love and passion for the art. the music can feel like a job and at that point, the cynicism and disdain have completely taken over. I have had that feeling personally I have had an era where I genuinely didn't like a lot of the music coming out. I had to change my mindset for some albums in order to enjoy them again. I realized not every album is a Michelin star meal, sometimes fast food is good. Albums this year like trippie redd and YB have a lot of tracks but don't really say much as an album. Yet I was able to find enjoyment in them by turning off my mind and just feeling the energy. That trippie redd album sounded so good to me while I was playing MW2, and I'm a grown-ass man I don't listen to trippie at all but that night it just hit different.  Some music on the other hand is rewarding to dissect. For me personally, Vince Staples's Ramona Park Broke my heart has become my favorite album of all time due to my dissection and analysis of the album. the beauty of the music is you can make it as deep as you want it and to me, that album has significant meaning that I can bore you all day about, but that's a post for another time.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Thank you so much for reading my article it feels good to be writing again. I forgot how much I enjoyed this. In other random life updates, I am picking up drawing again, doing Judo tomorrow, hitting the gym consistently and I am trying to get back into the swing of music. I have a plan for my music and I don't wanna let myself down, but with my mood feeling motivated again and my music sounding perfect I have no doubt that I can do it. Thank ya so much again for reading and have a great day !!!</p>

  <h2>Fish & Resolutions | The Pink Fish Theory</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">	Just yesterday I was feeding my fish at my dad's house. Due to winter break, I have spent a lot more time at home than usual, so seeing all my pets is a nice perk. I love all my pets from my loud old-ass Yorkie who is still full of life and will do anything for food, my loving and loyal cat, and my dad's socially awkward German Shepard. I love them all and see that they have great and unique personalities. However, there is one pet I have yet to mention and that is my pet fish, it is a pink kissing gourami and in its 14-year life, we have never given it a definitive name. The fish was one of the original fish I got as a little kid and has seen some absolute horror movie-level shit. I used to have a catfish that legit ate a solid 5 fish and even cut up the pink kisser. I later ended up lamenting that damn catfish when he ate my school of colorful fish that I colorfully called the skittle squad. After the catfish finally passed all that remained was the pink kisser in the tank that doubled as both a graveyard and a prison. 14 years spent in the same four corners and everyone they knew they saw die. What was its purpose for living? Matter of fact the tank they reside in is too small, when I educated myself more on fish care I realized that the pink kissing gourami needs to live in a 75-gallon tank while the tank I own is a measly 10 gal. Fish living in undersized tanks literally implode due to their organs growing larger than their body allows... yet mine still stands. This isn't a flex or me being a sociopath, I got this fish when I was just a kid and PetSmart markets Fish more as fashion accessories rather than a serious responsibility. They let me and encouraged me to get a big selection for that tiny ass tank and my excited ass obliged. The 75-gallon tank is expensive and takes up too much space, and I can't just let the fish out in the wild for it will surely die due to not knowing how to hunt. I decided that its best course of action is just to coast it out and eventually die.

  <br>
    <p class="blog">	Now, what does this have to do with resolutions? well traditionally I have never been a new years fan, I used to think that people never really changed from their "true nature". However, through my own personal growth and the countless transformations I have seen firsthand, I have found a new perception of life. We can change in fact it is what we are supposed to do. As quoted by John Henry Patterson "Only fools and dead men don't change their minds. Fools won't. Dead men can't.". I was a fool, stubborn in my own ways and ideals, but I am genuinely glad I am starting to be more open to new ideas and philosophies. One thing that is a sign of my newfound openness is my new love for holidays and their symbolic meanings. Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's have all found a new meaning for me and have made me appreciate life and the people in it far more than I could have ever imagined.     </p>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	New Year's is great because it is a symbolic fresh start. People who tend to detest the day have a problem of framing it wrong. They tend to frame it as a fresh start from their problems, while in actuality it is a fresh start for your own mind. Outside nothing changes and you can never truly control it anyways, the only thing you can control is yourself and the decisions you make. It is up to you to not only set goals and standards for yourself but to also maintain and improve upon them. That level of accountability and responsibility excites me personally as a true way to challenge and measure my own growth. So for this new year, I would like to make some solid resolutions and plan them out.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="blog"><i><b>Part I. the physical</b></i></p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	Okay, this one is probably the easiest to state, but hardest to maintain, but I want to get a workout routine going. where I work at least 4 times a week. I do not wish to be a big muscle man, but I would love a leaner body. I will also be holding myself to a far stricter diet. while I usually don't eat a lot, what I do eat tends to be rather unhealthy. I need to cut down on candy and fast food and increase my intake of vegetables and fruits. My ultimate goal with this regiment isn't to get all the bad bitches or whatever... I just want to be able to kick my brother's ass again.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="blog"><i><b>Part II. the arts</b></i></p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	Storytime, back in middle school I used to take a karate class, and every day after school this bus would pick my brother and me up. The bus was filled with my fellow peers and it drove us to the dojo, now one of my peers was a kid named Ian. Ian had a chipmunk ass head and would always be joking around. He was super funny and I would laugh my ass off on that bus. one of those days the bus hit a speed bump and that kid Ian had his cheeks bust a whole emote. I have never seen cheeks move like that and I genuinely laughed at it for a solid 30 minutes and it became one of the best jokes on that bus. That is when my inspiration struck. I had a spare spiral notebook at home and quickly started making my comic book based around Ian and his fat cheeks. On the bus, I would talk to Ian about his life and whatnot and I would use that as inspiration for this whole world I created. He would tell me about this annoying girl in his school named Mariah who bullies him, so I made her my main antagonist, his sidekick was his real-life best friend and our sensei was his master in the comic who would yell at him and pester him about everything. The story I crafted was very nonsensical and I wore my inspirations on my sleeve without a doubt. The original trilogy of Ian comics was inspired by Captain Underpants, Star Wars, and Adventure time. Oddly enough though looking back on the character I do find a lot of similarities between Ian and Luffy, Especially with their body-stretching fighting styles and goofy personalities. Now that story aside, we come to the question... "what do I want to do?". I want to learn how to draw and eventually make my own comic. I want to create a grand story that spans multiple volumes and chapters, Something that will entertain me and my taste because as a kid I was not a fan of reading, but I would laugh my ass off at my own comics. is it narcissistic? Probably, but if I don't like what I'm making then why would I even make it?</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="blog"><i><b>Part III. The Mental</b></i></p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	Okay, so if you read my "I dropped an album" and my "I Fucking Love One Piece" articles then you would have seen I identified some things that I changed mentally, but I would like to add onto that as well. This year I want to find the beauty in everything, I am sick of hating things, so I will push my taste to a new level and find to time to enjoy the journey of greatness more than the results of it. I want to be optimistic to try everything and even when I don't succeed I don't want to be deterred. I want to enjoy the process of learning just as much as mastering things.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="blog"><i><b>The Pink Fish Theory</b></i></p>
<br>
<p class="blog">	My Fish and Vince Staples, are to be credited for this theory I am about to present. We are all fish in tanks that are too small for us. The tank is a metaphor for our mindset and the fish is ourselves, mind > matter. We need to constantly evolve and grow our minds or else we will die. death in a spiritual sense, as a state of stillness in development. The beauty of it all is that we only have to focus on growing our minds rather than our physical bodies. When you give the fish a bigger thank it will allow it to naturally grow. Same with our own bodies, when you have big goals and a positive mindset then you will find yourself unconsciously growing and becoming stronger. we are designed to dream bigger than what we are, just like the fish cannot be bigger than the tank it is in. Thank you so much and have a happy new year. I hope that all your goals and plans are set in motion and that you continue to grow. - MouSa.</p>

  <h2>I FUCKING LOVE ONE PIECE</h2>


 <!--Insert the thumbnail text here!-->
 <p class="blog">Well hello again, it's me, Mousa. Now as some of you may or may not know I have been on a short little hiatus from the internet (well social media). During my break, I have decided to catch up on many things. I have decided to read more (currently taking book recommendations), self-care through exercise and therapy as well as eating better, and lastly I have been watching a lot of anime. Mostly Naruto, Mob Psycho, and now possibly one of my new favorite anime <b>One Piece</b>. through a mixture of reading the manga and watching the episodes at night, I have been able to get to the middle of the Arabasta arc (episode 117 in the anime). Without a doubt, I have never felt so touched before emotionally when watching tv. Oda is able to craft a world that is so inviting and truly encourages me to push harder and be better. When I see Luffy proclaim his dreams of being the pirate king I find myself gaining confidence in my own dreams.</p>

<!--Insert the rest of your blog's text here!-->
    <p class="blog">	Of course, to truly achieve those dreams you don't only need confidence in yourself but you also need confidence and trust in those around you. This is where I personally fell short in the past and I apologize I should trust some of yall more. My distrust didn't come from a false superiority but more so a fear of nobody being able to truly relate to me. Thankfully though seeing the straw hat pirates gain each other's trust I felt myself being more open vicariously. Every Straw hat I have met (so far) has taught me a valuable lesson, Luffy taught me I can take on the world with a good attitude and a good group of people. Zoro taught me the power of will and self-discipline and at times during my hiatus, I truly felt like him. Nami taught me how to trust people you initially didn't like at all. Sanji taught me about the purity of positive emotions like love and bonds. Tony Tony Chopper taught me about fighting for a cause despite the odds like a true pirate. IDGAF bout how cringe this shit sounds A MF LIKE I actually cried watching this show so many times. When Luffy called on Nami in arlong park, Chopper's backstory, hell even the damn dog from the first arc had me crying. Oh wait I forgot Usopp... ermm I like dude but he be lying too much tbh lol I was already good at lying before though so maybe he gets braver later in the show. I love all the straw hat pirates and I will not forget what they represent to me.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="blog">	Tying it all together now. I am back on the internet now but not as an escape from my reality which had only caused my existential angst and fears, but more so as a way to truly solidify my bonds to the outside world. The truth of the matter is I was good alone I found a job now, I am talking to a therapist right now and I have been on top of my assignments, while this may be good I am in search of better. What I truly value in my life is an adventure, and while I don't truly know where it will take me I am sure as hell to enjoy the company and stories along the way. In the end, it isn't the one with the most power who is the happiest, it is the one who is the freest. I am in search of my freedom and I can't achieve the goal without my crew. and there will always be room for you if you want to be my friend.</p>
